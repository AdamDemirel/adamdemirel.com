 Here are a few of my own:

 06/06/16:  What triggers puberty? To clarify - why do certain biology changes occur consistent with our objective measure of age/time? More crudely - "how does your biology know your age?" Is it just that we are undergoing a continuous additive process from birth?

 3/ cont.
similar to how baby's undergo a consistent development pattern from single cell to baby by adding cells in a systematic fashion?

Q2. 30/10/17: how did hormones evolve?

Q3. May 2016: Are blood tests not nearly useless without knowing the receptor density? You can have saturated plasma of a particular compound but studies on tolerance show that the receptor site gets pulled inside the cell given enough stimulation.
Maybe they are a useful proxy for a diagnosis though, as plasma levels would be a rate-limiting step assuming neutral receptor density.

Q4. April 2016. How does coffee relate to capitalism? I stumbled across the odd finding that the wealthiest countries are highly correlate with the  highest coffee consuming countries (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_GDP_per_capita and https://web.archive.org/web/20120518064208/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_coffee_consumption_per_capita). Correlation or causation?
Or more interestingly - is almost identical to the happiest countries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report#2018_report
