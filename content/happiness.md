The purpose of this essay is to attempt to unravel and answer the age old ethical question "what is happiness?" and in doing so converge on an accurate model of what the desirable life looks like.

Given the time I've spent researching this field, there seems to be three methods used in attempting to answer the question:
* Happiness Stories
* The scientific method
* Self experimentation

## Happiness Stories

The first and default method that most people rely upon in attempting to form a happiness model about the world is to observe and talk to other people. This can take the form of reading narratives, watching narratives, or simply talking to others.

Whether or not this is a reliable method is questionable, but what is useful is that these folk theories may give us hints about which areas to look further into or new ideas to test (via science and our own self experimentation).

## The Scientific Method

The second method that we can use is the scientific method. That means using a systematic set of observations as an attempt to quanify and arrive at answers which go beyond a single person, and in a more standardised manner. Such tools are valuable because they can overcome biases / blind spots individuals may have by using [larger datasets of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). There are a handful of scientific tools that can be used - questionnaires, brain scans, facial expressions, and others. As you will see, the simple questionnaire has dominated a lot of the happiness research.

We are lucky that we now no longer need to rely on introspecting or making conjectures about happiness, but have the ability to peruse the large body of literature on the subject.

## Self Experimentation & Self Awareness

The third method is what people use informally, which is relying on their own personal experience as a guide to what makes them happy and unhappy. This is how most people live their lives - reacting to immediate feedback in their environment and deciding what feels good and what feels bad, and ideally changing their behavior accordingly.

The main drawback of this is that we often [lack awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion) into what makes us feel good and bad, and even if we know we don't usually crystallize in language which is helpful for deciding we want more or less of it.

But again, obviously this is helpful as a imperfect but valuable tool and is also the final metric we will use. Who cares what the research says if our individual exprience is the opposite? I agree, but what's useful is that science and happiness stories might provide us with ideas to self experiment with to get our own first-hand data.

What is Happiness? This is probably one of the most important questions of this essay. To be able to attain something or seek after it, you must have some idea of what it is.

- Pleasure and pain are not merely physical sensations, but mental states taken about physical sensations, events in the world, beliefs, and memories also. (See

- a happy person is a lucky person.

success 29.07.17: - Had the idea that one form that 'success' can take is being *the best in the world* at something. I got the idea from watching the king of kong documentary. This form of success also seems to be reflected in a lot of other things which I have observed. Like world barista championships. Sports chamionships.. Etc.
-- eg rephrase to something along the lines of "some could view success as being aworld class performer"

Ancient History


What makes Epicurus distinct in his belief about pleasure being the goal of living is that he believed that the best way to go about achieving pleasure is merely through satisfying simple desires. For instance, he thought that “barely bread and water could yield the peak of pleasure”.

There is a lot that can be said about Epicureanism, and it may seem incompetent if I summarise and clarify it in a few lines, but I believe that it can be done faithfully. And it is as follows:

The first salient principle that Epicurus is making is that the removal of basic biological desires which are necessary for survival (like eating) is the most efficient way to reach an emotional state of maximum pleasure. He called these “static pleasures” to oppose them to what he called “positive pleasures” or “kinetic pleasures” which result from doing something which results in pleasure, but which doesn't remove a biological desire (like drinking wine). So, this state of what he called “ataraxia” is one “free from desire and its discomforts”, and he believes that pleasure (his goal of life) is “freedom from pain.. and fear”.

The second principle is that he gives special importance to friendship along with the first principle. He thought that it is only through close friends is this freedom from anxiety and “peace of mind” possible.

I believe that these two principles are in strong opposition and thus make his view contradictory. The reason being that his first principle is a value system which emphasises only physical pains and pleasures, and yet his second principle argues that the way to remove anxiety and desire (both psychological states and attitudes) is through socialising.
Now this may not look contradictory at first, and it can be conceded that perhaps socialising is a biological need just like eating. But what cannot be ignored is that if he admits that there exist such things as psychological pains (like anxiety) which are distinct from physical pains, then he must leave open the possibility for all sorts of things having the ability to cause psychological pains besides biological needs. And in doing so he must also admit that the removal of these psychological pains as a method for achieving pleasure (psychological pleasure) may be just as legitimate as his first principle.

Alas, he does make a distinction between 3 kinds of desires:
1. Desires which are natural, and necessary
2. Desires which are natural, but unnecessary and “trivial”
3. Desires which are unnatural and unnecessary

He splits the first kind of desire – natural and necessary, into 3 more kinds:
1. Desires necessary for happiness
2. Desires necessary to promote freedom from bodily discomforts
3. Desires necessary for the maintenance of life itself.

These 3 are categorically separate but in essence have the same consequence in terms of value. The desires which are necessary for happiness are the desires which are necessary to promote freedom from bodily discomforts. The desires which are necessary to promote freedom from bodily discomforts are also the desires necessary for the maintenance of life itself.

His reasoning is quite simple, but quite sophisticated. His argument is that the removal of mental and physical pains is the goal of life, because once we remove them, we no longer desire pleasure or the removal of pain. Everything we do is to achieve freedom from psychological pain (like fear) and physical pain, and once we do this we are calmed and do not continue seeking something which is absent or searching for something to add to our lives.

In concrete terms: We only have the need for pleasure when we feel a pain, but whenever we do not feel pain then we no longer need pleasure.

The Problem with Epicureanism
His theory seems valid, except for one crucial detail which undermines the whole enterprise. I wholly agree that by observing human behaviour, you can accurately arrive at the pleasure principle: that most or all of human behaviour can be explained by their need to avoid pain, and to seek pleasure (which is motivated by pain). But I think he is deeply wrong in assuming that it is simple to come about freedom from psychological pains. I agree that the removal of physical pains is relatively simple – supplying food, water, etc, and even the presence of friends. But I by no means think that doing this subsequently causes a complete freedom of psychological pains – like anxiety, fear, etc, that he describes. What results when you have satisfied your basic desires? You will eventually experience all sorts of psychological pains, but most important is boredom. Boredom is a psychological pain which results when one is aimless – which is exactly what results by doing what Epicurus suggests. Time needs to be filled with something – and it can't be completely filled with removing physical needs – because such basic needs are finite. Even socialising, though important, is easy to satisfy and dulls eventually.

Happiness produced is 70k

### Habits
habits (in comparison to swb single retro judgement): > Habits optimize for recursive emotional responses. Habits of thoughts (memories and forecasts) and behaviours

CONCLUSION >> So the best way to live is to find ways in which you can improve your circumstances (like working) that are combined with escapism (like flow) so when you experience inter-flow rumination, you feel less bad and have the means (like money) to experience more pleasure? >> Thus, still chase pleasures and minimise pains, but not at the expense of improved circumstances which is most important. Also, seek flow as much as possible.

### purpose of thoughts
- memory -> then emotional response
- affective forecast /prediction / visualisation -> emotional response
in comparison to environmental triggers/cues -> self talk -> emotional response

emotional response -> behavioral response (or extinguishment of) -> feedback loop into A

-- emotional responses may be rewarding or punishing

 experienced self / esm:

Your behaviours of what rewards you seek and punishes avoid, are not based on some complex forms of reasoning and analysis, but mere intuition shortly preceding each behaviour in time.

Your life does not exist in some sort of capsule where you can experience your Total pleasures and pains at each point, and trying to maximise pleasures completely or minimise pains completely is a futile endeavour, as you can do neither.

- Life (meaning the totality of thoughts and emotional experiences) is predominantly the lump sum/totality of single events that we do repeatedly/repeat. (ie ferris “life is the sum of the small things that we do repeatedly”)

31/01/17: experience sampling method still being problematic due to it relying on self report.


- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method

What you can control is what you do at each small interval in time. “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.” - Steve Jobs

Goal Setting is a way to verbalise your intuitions of what you think will make you the happiest at each point. Its probably good to do this just to have a concrete anchor to refer back to for justifying the aversive consequences of your behaviour, like work.

There are three sorts of phenomena that you can control in an attempt to improve the overall quality of your life: your brain chemistry, your thought patterns, and your environment.
- The main determinants of brain chemistrys effects on life quality are: serotonin transporter speed (gxe determined), amount of substrate in system (nutrition determined – complex dietary interactions and amino acids etc), not depleting ones neurotransmitters through excessive stimulation (porn, internet, etc), environmental triggers which cause the production and release of neurotransmitters (and absence of negative ones. See below).
- The main determinants of thought patterns: sensory stimulus in immediate environment (so control your environment – the people you surround yourself with, the activities you spend your time on, and your work and living location), and your explanatory style (seligman).
- The main determinants of your environment are: x

The more that an activity is done repeatedly, the more value it has in determining the quality of your life. This likely encapsulates and explains the measurements of subjective wellbeing and why job satisfaction is the #1 correlate with life satisfaction, because you spend a majority of your life working (and sleeping).

The concept of small wins is also valuable to motivate positive habit formations, as it demonstrates that larger and larger rewards can accrue over time with small but regular behaviours.

So basically there are sets of events which give you pleasure, and sets of events which cause you pain. It is a bit more complex, because some events last longer than others, have more intensity, and have the ability to cause reward by surpassing the pain, or have the ability for diminishing returns, etc.

Humans essentially have a set point for wellbeing that they return to relatively quickly after an event of pain or pleasure, which renders the events only moderately valuable, but still worth pursuing. What is a great endeavour I think is trying to modify the setpoint to a different level. I think this set point is titled hedonic tone in psychology.

Happiness is still more illusory than these previous concepts because of Kahneman's distinction between experienced utility and remembered utility.  ---

esm is when you have a handheld pc, and several times a day it asks a few questions like your location, activities engaged in before the prompt, whom you were interacting with, current subjective experience (the extent that you feel the presence or absence of various feelings with affective category descriptors/adjectives: like anger, hapy, worried, tired, impatient, deressed 0-6 not at all to very much)

## Habits
Our life is a sum of the small activities that we do repeatedly. (13.07.17: aka habits)
>> I think why all of my other theories got this premise wrong is because humans have a tendency to think globally in the whole scale of life, and not linearly that life is a secession of discrete events. (This point was raised in before sunset that he mentions how crazy it is that this is our life that we are living right now.) (“Tomorrow will be like today. Life wastes itself whilst we are preparing to live. - Ralph Waldo Emerson”)

- After all my hedonism theorism, ive concluded that even accounting for jouissance and nietzsche, the most important thing is habit.  [24/08/16 I think what I meant by this was what tim ferris said: life is the sum of small activities done repeatedly] / circumstantial goals

- the pleasure response isnt a sinewave! 1 or 0! its a function. Eg see alcohol chart. (time x axis, hedonic tone y axis. peaks shortly and later drops) (or university where you have the oscillating pleasure of a novel environment and socialising with friends, with a big drop after 4 yr  bachelors and financial debt recovery )
  - a very basic example is the sexual response cycle where your intensity of arousal goes from baseline to high, and then peaks in an orgasm before dropping back down.
Or fapping = peak pleasure cumming, then post = low energy, fatigue, no libido. X axis= pain/pleasure. Y axis = time.



# Eliminating Pains
- Flow theory / flow psychology
- "problems"
- https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-23653-008 systematic phenomenology?
- Nietzches idea that pains act as a flagpost to what needs our attention (from school of life)
- Evolution of negative thoughts - negativity bias
  - * Humans (and evo psych) are merely the result of the irrational process of survival and reproduction in genes (will to survive). Pleasure evolved as a reward for the avoidance of pain. How much of a pessimistic or optimistic bias we have when ruminating about the past and future is largely conditioned and a result of thinking habits/patterns which can be changed. Do further research.(read buddhas brain) So “change negative thinking about how the subject feels about themselves, about others and the future” (positive psychology) because belief/disbelief influences the future and the subjects willingness to avoid pain (learned helplessness).
  - * I previously thought the result of evolution was that psych pains always outweighed pleasures regardless of circumstances, but now realise thats not true after seeing blue zones. So the result is that existence is a mistake only for THOSE who arent born wealthy, attractive or raised to be intelligent. The good news is that one can be all these 3 things with enough effort.
  - counterargument: 19.05.18: we tend to remember positive memories longer than negative ones https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658210902791665 from happy money p15 - This is not to say tht all negativity evaporates from our memories.

- 30.12.16 nozick criticism: instead of nozicks pleasure machine. what about pain avoidance machine

## MAXIMISE SENSORY PLEASURES
- Aka Cyrenaicism, Aristippus, positive hedonism
- Imprudent, fleeting. Memories of sensory pleasures and weak and our future may end up bleak with no recourse or help from the past.
- Doesn't account for psychological pains (enduring) such as memories or expectations, psychological desires for girlfriend/compassion/friends/job, boredom etc.

## MAXIMISE PSYCHOLOGICAL PLEASURES
- A circumstantial improvement of ones life would mean curating circumstances which make pleasures (psych and sens) most likely to occur, pains least likely, maximise flow if necessary and minimise inter-flow states of rumination. A sort of self-help/self-sufficiency theory of happiness.
- Some people have good circumstances naturally (rich and attractive) while others have to work hard towards them.

## JOUISSANCE
- We get jouissance obtained in place of the full satisfaction of jouissance expected (relating to psych desires). So attaining our desire is never as great as we expect nor are psych pleasures.
- You don't solve desires to be complete, because you can no longer want it, you only want the fantasy of it. Plus others take their place.  JRE noted this when he said at 40 he realised theres no moment of full happiness or satisfaction you reach – the ride just continues on.
- How to account for this in the previous historical and conceptual analysis?

# MINIMIZING PAINS
## MINIMISE PSYCHOLOGICAL PAINS
- Minimise psychological pains by losing self-reflective consciousness.
- Psychological pains are not only taken at the present, but also past and future – thus more enduring. And more important to people who are more reflective and live inside their mind like myself. Accounts for sadism, memories, expectations, psych desires.
  - Forms: escapism, stoicism, buddhism, alcohol, flow, zapffe, schopenhauer sublimation, terror management theory
  - Therefore, escapism, nietzsche, pleasureseeking arent all opposed but linked in a metamodernist perspective of oscillation, but the problem is ive been sacrificing circumstances at the expense of pleasure/flow.
- Stoicism idea: “psych pain is inevitable, psych suffering is optional”. Then what do we do or desire, bc desire is basically synonymous with pain and if we don't desire then there's no reason to even eat or live. Needs to demarcate its limits. Also, as long as suffering is in your mind, you suffer regardless of opinion, there's no illusion of choice. To say it's optional is to say you can choose not to have those thoughts, which you cannot choose to force out of your head – but you can enter non self reflective consciousness via flow. So stoicism amounts to escapism.
- Flow is focusing attention in a consistent manner. The perk of it is that it is infinitely renewable (like movies, chess, pool, socialising, internet etc) and also easily obtained, as opposed to improving circumstances which require more effort and pain.
- The problem with flow/escapism is that it is also fleeting, there are inter-flow gaps where you realise your poor circumstances and experience psychological pain. And we can't constantly be in flow.


## MINIMISE SENSORY PAINS
- Aka negative hedonism, epicureanism
- Sensory means relates to organs: tacticle (massage/sex/itch), visual (film/art), auditory (music), gustatory (food), olfactory (scent). Not robust enough, see 1.2. Taken only at the present – fleeting.
- This would be sufficient (and we could live completely in the present, but thats not the case) if humans didn't experience psychological pains (enduring) such as memories or expectations, psychological desires for girlfriend/compassion/friends/job, boredom etc.


----
----

# MAXIMIZING PAINS
## specifically psychological pains
- Nietzsche thought happiness didn't come from escaping pains but cultivating them because pains are flagposts which draw our attention to what needs to be done (so don't escape them but curate them). Life affirmative philosophy – attempts to embrace consciousness. No pain no gain.
- If improving your circumstances (like working) is painful, that means they are still flagposts to change your behaviour (ie find a more fulfilling job).

# Optimize base level / Hedonic Tone
- Hedonic Tone / emotional complexion
  - neurohedonism
- Cig biology etc
- Sleep


“- CONSIDER rewriting my ethical theory in terms of motivation being neuropsychological and life goals as maximising dopamine output // and how the traditional attitudinal/sensory distinction was just mindless intellectual posturing and arbitrary categories.”

I'd like to title this theory neurohedonism, and as it stands, I dont think the word has ever been used.
- I've concluded that all of the theoretical distinction collapses between attitudinal and sensory hedonism are irrelevant to the central dogma of hedonism which modern biology is naturally suggesting but nobody has seemed (as far as I know) to have explicitly stated in hedonistic theory – that pleasure, whether sensory or attitudinal, is good, and it is the **expression of particular neurotransmitter activity.**

- Thus, pleasure is the **expression of particular neurotransmitters and pain is the expression of others.**

- From my current understanding, the pleasure neurotransmitters which should be sought to be maximised are Dopamine, Serotonin, Norepinephrine, opoids, and maybe dynorphin, epinephrine
- From my current understanding, the pain neurotransmitters are Substance P (related to pain signalling, mentally and physically), and glucocticoids (cortisol in humans which is the stress response).
- The normative question then becomes how to maximise some neurotransmitters and reduce others? This is where I think modern science finally usurps philosophy in ethics as it has in all the other fields
- With a proposition such as “the more of certain transmitters, the better/more good/higher the value of the experience” one can easily see how quantifiable/falsifiable replies to objections of locke and bentham can be produced.
- I feel as if this could be extremely influential in political policies
- Another reformulation would be “the more of particular neurotransmitters the life contains, the better the life”
- So for objections like at the end of Feldman “the repugnant response” or whatever that a life containing a lot of small pleasures and nothing else is adverise, perhaps its because its speaking in abstract language like the rest of hedonistic theory has and missed that perhaps having small static levels of particular positive neurotransmitters like dopamine doesnt offset dysthemia or small persistent static levels of negative ones which produce boredom or pain

on the other end of the stick if this is all overwhelming one possible way to live your life is to live in the moment and do whatever is most immediately imperative to you.

## maximizing pleasure
25/08/16: Although there is some plausability to lacans jouissance theory, it is one of those woopy spoopy philosophical ideas, because the idea of pain and pleasure do clearly still exist as reward and punishment mechanisms. Provide someone with a painful and rewarding experience side by side and see which one they prefer. This simple state of preference is what i am after, not some grand cognitive satisfaction that is illusory.

# neurohedonism
maximise adrenaline, oxytocin and dopamine
-- exercise, socially bond, and take wellbutrin?
-- quit movies and computer (lowers dopamine, seeking system)
-- quit porn (lowers dopamine, seeking system)
-- hug people daily

minimise cortisol
-- by doing above,

* There is a handful of Neurotransmitters which are implicated in well-being:
- Only Dopamine, Serotonin, and Norepinephrine out of the ~100 neurotransmitters seem to be implicated in depression. Epinephrine is also implicated in wakefulness. And Glucocorticoids in modulating the stress response.
* The value/happiness of one's life is determined by the balance of the relevant neurotransmitters.
* Keep in mind the human brain is plastic and is changing every second. Fire together wire together.


* The main factors that contribute to the balance of the relevant neurotransmitters are:
– Whether or not you have the **depression gene** ((1) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12161658 (Technically, The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the promotor region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), not the gene itself. (1b) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12869766  – This paper showed that individuals who carried a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) were more vulnerable to developing depression following exposure to stressful life events.. (1c) http://brainworldmagazine.com/the-new-new-genetics-gets-practical/) Stressful life events were measured as employment, financial, housing, health, and relationship stressors.), in conjunction with **stressful early life** events which increases likelihood of depression (Gene x Environment interaction). This explains why stressful events lead to depression in some people but not in others.

- Massages increase dopamine and serotonin, and decrease cortisol (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162447)
– Coffee increases Serotonin transmission, but you build up a tolerance and may have withdrawals without it.
- Take fish oil daily, as deficiency in omega 3 can result in mood disorders (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16741195)
- The ability to delay gratification is the #1 predictor of future success (?). Interestingly, the ability to delay gratification is mediated by serotonin levels (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18434531).
- Taking antidepressant drugs (SSRI, SNDRI etc.) to off-set the negative brain chemistry consequences (depression) of stressful early life events
- Not depleting one's reward system through excessive porn or masturbation (http://www.yourbrainonporn.com/adolescent-brain-meets-highspeed-internet-porn)
- Engaging in regular exercise (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise#Depression)
– How much physical intimacy one receives as a child (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11523842)
