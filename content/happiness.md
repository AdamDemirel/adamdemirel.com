The purpose of this essay is to attempt to unravel and answer the age old ethical question "what is happiness?" and in doing so arrive at arrive on a model of what desirable lives may looks like.

Given the time I've spent researching this field, there seems to be three methods used in attempting to answer the question:
* Happiness Stories
* The scientific method
* Self experimentation

## Happiness Stories

The first and default method that most people rely upon in attempting to form a happiness model about the world is to observe and talk to other people. This can take the form of reading narratives, watching narratives, or simply talking to others. Whether or not this is a reliable method is questionable, but what is useful is that these folk theories may give us hints about which areas to look further into or new ideas to test (via science and our own self experimentation).

## The Scientific Method

The second method that we can use is the scientific method. That means using a systematic set of observations as an attempt to quanify and arrive at answers which go beyond a single person, and in a more standardised manner. Such tools are valuable because they can overcome biases / blind spots individuals may have by using [larger datasets of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). There are a handful of scientific tools that can be used - questionnaires, brain scans, facial expressions, and others. As you will see, the simple questionnaire has dominated a lot of the happiness research.

## Self Experimentation & Self Awareness

The third method is what people use informally, which is relying on their own personal experience as a guide to what makes them happy and unhappy. This is how most people live their lives - reacting to immediate feedback in their environment and deciding what feels good and what feels bad, and ideally changing their behavior accordingly.

The main drawback of this is that we often [lack awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion) into what makes us feel good and bad, and even if we know we don't usually crystallize in language which is helpful for deciding we want more or less of it.

But again, obviously this is helpful as a imperfect but valuable tool and is also the final metric we will use. Who cares what the research says if our individual exprience is the opposite? I agree, but what's useful is that science and happiness stories might provide us with ideas to self experiment with to get our own first-hand data.
