> If you don't get what you want, you suffer; If you get what you don't want, you suffer; Even when you get exactly what you want, you still suffer because you can't hold on to it forever. Your ind is your predicament. It wants to be free of change. Free of pain, free of the obligations of life and death. But change is law and no amount of pretending will alter that reality. - Socrates

# Intro
The purpose of this essay is to attempt to unravel and answer the age old ethical question "what is happiness?" and in doing so converge on an accurate model of what the desirable life looks like.

Each of us has roughly 36,000 days to do something worthwhile with our limited time and use it in ways which make us feel good rather than bad. An hour read here could hopefully nudge how you spend a portion of those days.

![sadf](/images/happiness/timemonths.png)

What is Happiness? This is probably one of the most important questions of this essay. To be able to attain something or seek after it, you must have some idea of what it is. What I'm referring to by happiness will become clearer throughout the read, but at its core it's a value system. By [value system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiology) I mean a hierachy of preferences which can be used to inform decisions.

The methods of measuring happiness will differ depending on the area of study, but they all share the same common theme of trying to find an optimal set of outcomes.

> There was a wonderful paper that asked what happiness means at different points in history and in different cultures. And oddly enough, historically, happiness means **good fortune**. It doesn't mean the emotional response to having good fortune, it means good fortune itself. A happy person is a lucky person. It's not that a happy person is a lucky person, what it means to be happy is that you're lucky. This was the dominant definition pretty much everywhere and in modern cultures this definition has been replaced. (`[1](https://youtu.be/hjACfaEh9BM?t=1378)`, [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23599280))

But although this linguistic definition was used, it is not of much use to us because it is not actionable and if anything it is passive. The importance of this analysis and the modern happiness research is uncovering things that empower our decisions and alter our lives in large and small ways. So beyond good fortune, happiness must mean something else, and that something else is best defined and introduced by the ancient greek hedonists, which I will cover below.

Given the time I've spent researching this field, there seems to be three methods used in attempting to figure out what happiness is:
* Happiness Stories
* The scientific method
* Self experimentation

## Happiness Stories

The first and default method that most people rely upon in attempting to form a happiness model about the world is to observe and talk to other people about their beliefs. This can take the form of reading narratives, watching narratives, or simply talking to others.

There is wisdom in the crowd, in history, and in endless quotes which resonate with us personally. I personally believe quotes are quite underrated as a method of communicating value.

The problem with believing to be true merely what others believe to be true is that logically you can inverse their beliefs to be the opposite of what they are and make them false. Take for instance the belief that fruits give you an upset stomach. If everybody believes that this is true, but then you eat fruit and it turns out that this isn't true for you, what good is it to believe what others do? People have also believed a lot of things throughout history that have turned out to be outright false.

So this isn't really a reliable method of discovery, albeit common, but what is useful is that these [folk theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_psychology) may give us hints about which areas to look further into or new ideas to test (via the scientific method and our own self experimentation).

## The Scientific Method

The second method that we can use is the scientific method. That means using a systematic set of observations as an attempt to quantify and arrive at answers which go beyond a single person, and in a more standardised manner. Such tools are valuable because they can overcome biases / blind spots individuals may have by using [larger datasets of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). There are a handful of scientific tools that can be used - questionnaires, brain scans, facial expressions, and others. As you will see, the simple questionnaire has dominated a lot of the happiness research.

We are lucky that we now no longer need to rely on introspecting or making conjectures about happiness, but have the ability to peruse the large body of literature on the subject. This will predominantly be covered in the Maximising Pleasure -> Subjective Wellbeing section.

## Self Experimentation & Self Awareness

The third method is what people use informally, which is relying on their own personal experience as a guide to what makes them happy and unhappy. This is how most people live their lives - reacting to immediate feedback in their environment and deciding what feels good and what feels bad, and ideally changing their behavior accordingly.

The main drawback of this is that we often [lack awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion) into what makes us feel good and bad, and even if we know we don't usually crystallize in language which is helpful for deciding we want more or less of it.

Even if you knew with certainty which happiness stories were accurate, and you replicated the behaviors of beliefs you viewed as happy - there is going to be another subset of people that don't have the same effect. Let's say that you admire and respect the Buddhists and ascetics and lead yourself to believe that what they say is true and that dedicating your life to meditation is the single behaviour which will make you happy, there is going to be a large part of that population which is still "working towards nirvana" and is still unhappy.

This individuality and uniqueness of opinions and preferences is one of the big reasons we can't just base our lives on the opinions and advice of others, non-systematically. If we go about it systematically using the scientific method though, we might be able to give some rigor to the opinions of others.

But again, obviously this is helpful as an imperfect but valuable tool and is also the final metric we use. Who cares what the research says if our individual experience is the opposite? I agree, but what's useful is that science and happiness stories might provide us with ideas to self experiment with to get our own first-hand data.

# Ancient Greek History
The main type of happiness story I will cover is historical stories. Movies and fictional books are of less structure and use here. Obviously there are many happiness stories out there, narratives going back 1000 years in many cultures. Furtunately a lot of them can be captured under a handful of patterns. I think the important stories to discuss are a few of the Ancient Greek schools of thought, with the three most influential being *Epicureanism, Cyrenaicism*, and *Stoicism*. I think it is interesting that they are all related close in space and time and had opposing schools of thought to eachother, and it allows us to extract out the shared pattern.

There's a lot that can be said about each of these three schools, but I'm going to give a quick overview of three schools below as I don’t believe any account of happiness would be complete without covering them in some basic detail. I'm aware that there are other schools of thought which are classified as ancient but equally as influential, such as Buddhism. I am limiting myself to the Ancient Greeks here, as I will discuss Buddhism and others which are worth noting in their own sections at later points.

Interesting enough, even the most simple of organisms, the *Amoeba*, seems to display a "pain-like" and "pleasure-like" response, moving closer and feeding off of nearby foods and light, and avoiding noxious chemicals and other objects ([4](https://www.britannica.com/science/nervous-system)). And the amoeba is believed to be related to the earliest forms of life 800million years ago! So the motivation of organisms to be pleasure seekers and pain avoiders it not a new phenomena.

// place drawing of aemoeba

The question of how to be “happy” or live a happy life has been a question plaguing humans since time immemorial. Throughout most of animal history, animals would use their immediate environment as a guide to their behaviour — they would live their life completely immersed in each moment, responding to threats of danger and seeking food to keep themselves alive long enough to replicate their genes.


But at an unbeknown point, later humans developed enough sentience and freedom to begin to ask *how they could be better*. They began to ask *what should I do with this finite amount of time that i’m endowed?*

// small circle big circle

The ancient Greeks had a bit to say on this question, but unfortunately, their answers are quite crude and fall short on a few points. I am going to do my best to exclude details of the founding figures lives and principles which are not overtly relevant to answering the questions set out. To give one such example of a type of point I could repeatedly make is that Epicurus (discussed below) was the founder of a famous ‘Garden’ — a kind of Ashram, where he was the *guru*. The fact that he occupied a position of high prestige in a hierarchy like this *could* have had an influence on his well-being. But he never discusses it, and is likely unaware of it. I will not discuss such obvious confounds. Instead, I will focus merely on what they have attempted to communicate as principles to embody. So, what are the relevant principles that Epicurus emphasised?

## Epicureanism
![epicurus](/images/happiness/epicurus.jpg)

> "The acquisition of riches has been for many men, not an end, but a change, of troubles." -Epicurus

Epicureanism (3) is the school of thought founded on the writings of the individual [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus). Epicurus is considered a **Hedonist**, an important term which this essay could also be labelled arguing for. The popular culture usage of the word hedonism usually refers to *decadent hedonism*, which is more related to the indulgence of Cyrenaicism as you will see. A lot of scholars effortfully defend Epicureanism from falling under this same label.

There are two principles to Epicureanism: the first is that the *removal* of basic physical needs and desires results in the happiest state possible. That small list of needs are simple needs required for survival, what he called "basal desires", and include the need to sleep, to eat, to drink, and to avoid physical pains. He believed that once you removed the pain that comes with those basic needs (resulting in what he calls *static pleasures*), you have reached what he calls an [ataraxic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia) state — meaning *freedom from desire and discomfort*, a neutral state without pains or pleasures which is the peak of happiness. In his view, "barely bread and water could yield the peak of pleasure". Summarised simply, **happiness is freedom from pain and pleasure**.

The second principle is the importance of friendship to happiness. Although not a purely physical need, he deemed it necessary and thought that it is only through close friends that freedom from anxiety and "peace of mind" is possible.

Whether or not either of these is true, what he understood is that desire results from a particular deficiency, and that pleasure is the result of satisfying said deficiency. Epicurus refers to the pleasure that's the result of removing a pain a *static pleasure*, and scholars call it a *negative pleasure* (opposed to a *positive pleasure* which results from adding pleasure on top of a neutral state, or *kinetic pleasure* as epicurus calls it). Positive pleasure is pleasure which is the result of doing something that doesn't remove a biological desire, such as drinking alcohol. One of the main reasons that he thought negating desire is more preferable than the adding pleasures is because he believed that the latter leads to the further desire for more pleasures, which if cannot be sated leads to pain. Epicurus wrote his views in large part as a reaction to the Cyrenaics, which emphasised the *addition* of physical pleasures.

Epicureanism in its summarised for is that there are natural desires which are necessary for the maintenance of life, and these desires manifest as bodily discomforts, which when resolved result in happiness. These natural desires are separate and more important than the other unecessary and trivial desires.

This reasoning is quite simple, also quite sophisticated. His argument is that the removal of mental and physical pains is the goal of life, because once we remove them, we no longer desire pleasure or the removal of pain. Everything we are motivated to do is to achieve freedom from psychological pain (like fear) and physical pain (like hunger), and once we do this we don't feel the need to continue seeking something which is absent to add to our lives. In concrete terms: **We only have the need for pleasure when we feel a pain, but whenever we do not feel pain then we no longer need pleasure**.

### The problems with Epicureanism
There are two issues with epicureanism, one minor and one major.

#### Duration Neglect
The less severe first problem is that he didn't believe that longer pleasures were superior to shorter ones. If you accept that pleasure is good and pain is bad, obviously the more pleasure and the less pain you experience the better. Failing to acknowledge this is what psychologists call [duration neglect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duration_neglect), which is actually a common bias but is experientially naive. Obviously the duration is important.

#### Neglecting Psychological Pleasures & Pains
The major problematic aspect of Epicureanism is that although he acknowledges pleasure being the result of removing physical pains and desires, he doesn't give any weight at all to psychological pains and desires, or pleasure (beyond friendship).

As we saw, he argued that once you remove the physical pains, you are in a state of neutrality and contentness, but this is clearly incorrect as the absence of physical pains doesn't imply the absence of psychological pains. I agree that the removal of physical pains is relatively simple, but not so simple to eradicate all psychological pains such as sadness, anger, boredom, fear, etc, which can still be present in the absence of physical pains. Time needs to be filled with something, and it can't be completely filled with removing physical needs, because such needs are finite. What will result is boredom or psychological pains.

You can satisfy all of your basal desires but still live an unhappy life due to the many psychological pains that could be present. So the crux of the issue is that he is excluding a list of mental pains that have the ability to affect our happiness.

Additionally, he acknowledges the importance of friendship to removing psychological pains but ignores all other psychological pains and pleasures. This leads him into a contradictory position: on the one hand he emphasis a value system only of physical pains and pleasures, yet makes a single except for friendship. If he admits that there exists such things as psychological pains (like anxiety) which are distinct from physical pains, which friendship can remove, then he must leave open the possibility for all sorts of other psychological pains and pleasures. Then in doing so acknowledge that the removal of these is just as important as removing physical.

We saw that his reason for ignoring pleasures unecessary for survival was due to their riskiness of attainment, but the desire for non basic needs to be satisfied also have the ability to provide pleasure and is potentially pleasure missed. He is also making the assumption that the pain associated with not attaining the future pleasures outweighs the pleasure gained from partaking in them minus the pain of not attaining them.

These are the reasons that although epicureanism provides some important take aways regarding happiness which I will summarise shortly, cannot be relied upon entirely and warrants further research.

## Cyrenaicism

Epicurus' school of thought that the absence of pain is happiness is what's known as **negative hedonism** (negative meaning removal). In contrast, Cyrenaicism is a school of thought that is considered **positive hedonism**, meaning the addition of pleasures. These two schools are considered diametrically opposed, and the Epicureans were a reaction to the Cyrenaics.

The positive hedonists advocated a lifestyle which aimed to maximise pleasurable experiences. The major proponent of positive hedonism was an ancient greek philosopher named [Aristippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristippus) who lead a school of thought named the Cyrenaic school.

![aristippus](/images/happiness/aristippus.jpg)

Aristippus believed physical pleasures beyond a sated state, such as eating extravagant food, were of more importance than mental pleasures (such as 'knowledge' which the greeks also focused on). His argument was that sensory pleasures were of more importance than psychological pleasures due to them being more intense, because they are visceral.

He also believed that physical pleasures, what he called sensory pleasures, should be more sought after due to the higher ease and certainty of them being acquired than the distance experiences which result in psychological pleasure, such as mastery of a skill.

He believed that happiness consisted in gorging oneself with as many physical pleasures as one could - particularlty eating, drinking alcohol, and sex. This is the popular culture conception of hedonism nowadays. These pleasures can also be described as **pleasures of the senses**, in opposition to **pleasures of the mind**.

### The Problems with Cyrenaicism
Besides Cyrenaicism being the typical view of *hedonism* that most people associate the pursuit of pleasure with, and thus giving hedonism a negative connotation, there are a few other issues.

#### Duration neglect of mental pleasures
His argument about the uncertainty of future psychological pleasures is understandable once placed in his historical context - written at a time of war and short life expectancy, thus a perspective of scarcity. When life expectancy is relatively secured by a modern lifestyle, this is less uncertain.

Although he acknowledges that sensory pleasures are more intense, his approach is imprudent and doesn't consider the duration of psychological pleasures, which could lead to a larger hedonic aggregate - a higher total sum of pleasure over time. Physical pleasures are only experienced in the present, whereas psychological ones are exist in the past, present, and future, even if less intense.

So in summary, Aristippus advocated maximising physical pleasures, and cared little for avoiding pain or maximising psychological pleasures. We're starting to see a pattern here.

## Stoicism
The other negative hedonist school of thought which aims to minimise painful experiences were the [Stoics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism), lead by the individual Zeno.

![zeno](/images/happiness/zeno.jpg)

The Stoics wanted to live a life of peace and quiet, similar to the Epicureans. They thought that the addition of any sensory pains or sensory pleasures would disrupt their mental tranquility. But Epicureanism has little theory developed in way of mental pains like the Stoics do, and the Stoic form of *Ataraxia* includes both psychological pleasures and pains, and thereby becomes more encompassing if one considers psychological pains such as *desire, boredom, hatred, guilt*, or any of the other multitude of negative mental states or emotions, as we discussed in the issues with Epicureanism.

To counterpoint — take an ataraxic state in Epicureanism: all physical pains have been removed, but now the subject is theoretically existing in a state of boredom. Would it make sense to say that a whole life lived in boredom but with the absence of pain is a happy life? Ofcourse not. But it wasn’t completely commonsense for the Greeks to think of the mind as producing pains back then, usually only the environment. So the Stoics have the added advantage of realising that our mind itself may be a source of pleasure or pain, and this is aptly emphasised in the quote —

> “We are not troubled by things but the opinion which we have of things.” — Epictetus

They believed that both pains and pleasures disrupt mental peace and tranquility, and this led them to withdraw from the world and engage in tranquil meditation - a sort of voluntary negation of psychological pains and pleasures.

The stoics were principally very similar to Buddhist philosophy / ascetics, aiming to eliminate psychological pains. They both aimed for a life of peace which was free of tribulation or troubled emotions (ataraxia), a state which equates to Epicurus' notion of static pleasures.

### The problem with Stoicism
The same issue with the other schools also occurs with stoicism, that is, they have taken one extreme form on the hedonism axis, in this case - minimising all psychological pain and pleasure, and excluded the others. Just like the Epicureans neglected all psychological pleasures and pains, and just like the Cyrenaics neglected all psychological pains, so do the Stoics neglect all psychological pleasures. But the Stoics do have the advantage over Epicureanism that they acknowledge psychological states.

# Hedonism - What Happiness Is
So we've covered the three most influential greek schools of thought that paved the way for the development of later advances in happiness research. Although they disagree with eachother in different ways, what they do agree on is what I will call the first premise of hedonism: that **pleasure is positive and desirable** and **pain is negative and aversive**.

![green up arrow red down arrow](/images/happiness/updown.png)

Whether you want to call pleasure or pain something else, like *positive/negative emotions*, *positive/negative experiences*, *the satisfaction of desire*, or anything else, they do agree on this. What they disagree on is the importance of physical vs psychological pleasures/pains, and whether duration is important. We've already established that both physical and psychological pleasures/pains are important, and so is duration.

Though we arrived on the point that pleasure is good and pain is bad, this still falls short on one glaring point, which is obvious to anybody living in the 21st century: **pleasure is not happiness, and pain is not unhappiness**. The reason this is so is mostly to do with **duration**. If you are eating an enjoyable meal and experiencing pleasure, you may say you are happy, but that is merely a *report of your current experience*. If you said this and then lived the rest of your life in pain, it would be silly to state that you lived a happy life.

What this highlights is the importance of both **intensity** and **duration** of pleasure and pain, or simply **quantity**. As we've hinted, a life with **more** (intensity x duration) pleasurable experiences than painful experiences, the happier the life. If you argue that physical pleasures and small physical pains are not important, and what would be more impactful is very important life events - like marriage, achievement, parenting, or avoiding injury, this is still compatible with the premise above. It is compatible because it acknowledges that these events potentially have the ability to produce large quantities of pleasure and pain.

![sadf](/images/happiness/maxmin.jpg)

**The second premise of hedonism is that pleasure is the only intrinsic value, rendering a life without pleasure worthless**. One may hold values such as knowledge of value, but consider a life full of knowledge without mental pleasure or pain — it is neutral, it’s not preferable over anything (preference is essentially what *value* is!) In comparison, consider a life full of pleasure without knowledge. By using this dialectical reasoning, any additional value trait with the absence of pleasure can be seen less preferable than pleasure.

In fact, hedonistic philosopher [Fred Feldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Feldman_(philosopher)) wrote a [great book](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/019926516X.001.0001/acprof-9780199265169) which does an extremely good job defending this view of hedonism against every counter argument that you can think of.
Although he refers to psychological pleasures and pains as *attitudinal pleasures/pains* (because they are attitudes you have about the world - a very philosopher description - philosophers often talk about '[propositional attitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_attitude)'), he shows that any alternative to hedonism you can think of is simply nonsense when compared with it. Anything you describe as valuable, whether that be knowledge, love, aesthetics, can be captured under the idea of positive and negative experiences and therefore it is only rational to be a hedonist, in the sense of wanting to maximize good and bad emotions. To demonstrate the *positivity or negativity* of a stimuli, all that is required is to do is to compare them side by side and *choose which is more preferable*, which will always be the positive.

Feldman makes an interesting note that all physical pains and pleasures are psychological also, but not vice versa. For example, the positive experience of eating or the painful experience of being injured both have a physical nature and a psychological nature - if they didn't have a psychological nature you wouldn't experience them. It is only because an attitude is taken *about* a sensation of pleasure or pain that it is so. But that's not the case for psychological pleasures and pains where it is possible to experience them without a corresponding physical senstation. This makes them interesting because we can have psychological pleasures or pains about a set of events in the *past (via memory* or the *future (via mental forecasting*, or even about a set of events perceived in the present — such as the pleasure taken at the perception of an artwork. Thus all physical pleasures and pains are based in the *present* but not so for psychological. This opens up a whole new avenue of pleasures such as masochism, social pleasures, romantic pleasures, of accomplishment, recognition, service, fame.

In summary, the tenants of hedonism and thus happiness are as follows:
1. Pleasures and pains can be split into physical and psychological, or **pleasures of the senses**, and **pleasures of the mind**
2. The Epicureans believed that **removing physical pains** equalled happiness
3. The Cyrenaics believed that **adding physical pleasures** equalled happiness
4. The Stoics believed that **removing psychological pains** equalled happiness
5. Although it's up for debate on which view is the best, what all three had in common is their agreement in **hedonism**:
6. **The first premise of hedonism** is that pleasure is positive and pain is negative; the more pleasure you experience the better, the less pain the worse.
7. **The second premise of hedonism** is that pleasure is the only intrinsic value, rendering a life without pleasure worthless.
8. The intuitive critique to hedonism is it’s most obvious shortcoming: **pleasure is not happiness, and pain is not unhappiness**

So in conclusion, the hedonsitic view of happiness is that **pleasure is the only intrinsic good, pain is the only intrinsic bad. The more pleasure a life contains, and the less pain, the better the life is.**.

I buy this definition and I will argue why throughout, but the main reason is that if you define pleasure and pain broadly enough, eg in the sense that pleasure is "positive emotions" and pain is "negative emotions", then there is no other value that a life can contain that would be comparable. These states by definition are desirable and aversive, and even if people sacrifice these states in the short term (eg in the case of delaying gratification), they are doing so for better states later in time. There are many important figures throughout history who have held this same view, from the greeks above, to [Artistotle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/#Plea), to Jeremy Bentham (discussed below), to [John Stuart Mill](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/#MillConcHapp), to Sigmund Freud's [pleasure principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_principle_(psychology)), to [David Hume](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#inmo)'s informal account.

So given this outline, the mathematically best way to live a better life is to increase the total amount of pleasures and reduce the total amount of pains. Philosophers call the atomic unit of pleasure a [hedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus) and economists call them [utils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility).


## Pleasure/Pain Criteria
Extending on the view above, old mate [Jeremy Bentham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham) here came along in the 18th century and developed what he called [Hedonic Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus) was a method for attempting to measure pleasure and pain. The criteria he used to judge pleasures and pains were similar to some we've already discussed, but added a few more:
1. The intensity/strength
2. The duration
3. The certainty/uncertainty
4. How soon it will occur
5. The repeatability
6. Whether the pleasure is followed by a pain

![Jeremy Bentham](/images/happiness/bentham.png)

We've already seen how intensity and duration are important (as intensity x duration = total hedonic sum). And the greeks already discussed the certainty/uncertainty, and the distance somewhat. What they didn't really mention was the repeatability and whether it was followed by pain which are two interesting criteria to introduce.

> Humans don´t live in territories but in habits. — Peter Sloterdijk

Repeatability is interesting because doing a small thing enough times can compound to have large effects. So even if there are a few events which result in the largest pleasure gains and pain removals, perhaps there are activities that we can do repeatedly which can improve our lives in small ways which add up to a large total over time. This is a smart view to take when you consider that **our lives are a sum of the small activities that we do repeatedly** - whether that be sleep, eat, socialise, work, play, our thoughts, the environment we are in, or our daily habits. I'll label all of these recurring experiences as "habits", as they are repeated emotional responses.

What this additional criteria suggests is that one way to improve your happiness is to find ways in which you can make repeatable small gains in pleasure and the removal of pain, which add up over time. I think why a lot of happiness stories get this premise wrong is because humans have a tendency to think globally in the timespan of a whole life and spotlight large events, rather think linearly and acknowledge that life is a secession of discrete events. This reminds me of an interesting point brought up in the movie [Before Sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Sunset) where the main actor mentionns how crazy it is that we are **living** our life right now.

> “Tomorrow will be like today. Life wastes itself whilst we are preparing to live.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Another interesting point which is obvious to most people, is whether or not the pleasure will be followed by pain, or vice versa. Bentham referred to this as *Purity*. Most of us have an intuitive grasp on purity of experience and is one of the biggest objections we have against decadent hedonism - because we infer that gorging ourselves with physical pleasures or hard drugs is followed by pains, therefore lacking purity.

![a](/images/happiness/purity.jpg)

This acknowledges an important fact about the pain and pleasure response: it isn't a sinewave or binary, it's a function. The value of the experience changes over time depending on what it is and the inputs. This gives us an interesting metric by which to judge various pleasures and pains - by averaging them out over time.

For example, if you take out a loan to go travelling, you might experience a chunk of pleasure upfront but you will suffer for it afterwards. Another very basic example is the sexual response cycle which is quite standard: an intensity of arousal/pleasure build from baseline to high, and then peaks at a climax before dropping back down to near neutral or just below.

![Climax](/images/happiness/climax.png)

In summary of everything above, we've concluded that **a happy life can be evaluated by how much pleasure and pain it contains, due to them being the only intrinsic values. The more pleasure and the less pain, the better the life. Those pleasures/pains can be physical or psychological. And pleasures/pains differ in their intensity, duration, certainty, repeatability, and purity.** This means that to model how to improve happiness, we need to know how best to maximise pleasure and minimise pain.

The pattern that unfolded from studying the greeks is that there are four principle ways of categorising research methodologies for improving happiness, and behaviors for doing so:
1. Minimising pleasures
2. Maximising pains
3. Minimising pains
4. Maximising pleasures

There is a left-wing fifth but I will save it for last.

---

# Minimising Pleasures
Beyond the reasons given by the greeks about how seeking physical pleasures that weren't necessary for survival may lead to physical pain, which we discounted, there isn't really any strong reason to minimise pleasures, or schools of thought that advocate doing so. This is obviously going to be the least developed section of our 4 as it's difficult to imagine how a happy life could be arrived at by deliberately minimising pleasures as much as possible.

![minimise pleasure chart](/images/happiness/min-pleasure.jpg)

----

# Maximising Pains
Although for the same reasons as above it makes no sense to try to optimize happiness by directly maximising pains as much as possible (especially not severe negative emotions) such as:

![a](/images/happiness/max-pains.jpg)

What some figures did note is that the individual experiences of pain are not necessarily always overall bad, even if immediately bad in the short term. What I mean by bad is that just like we acknowledged that some pleasures are impure, so may pains be. Some pains have the possibility of being followed by pleasures and thus can potentially result in a greater pleasure total.

![a](/images/happiness/pain-minus-pleasure-total.jpg)

At the end of the day, positive emotions are still what's intrinsically valuable, and negative emotions are still what's intrinsically undesirable, but we've just acknowledged that small negative emotions can sometimes be followed by greater positive emotions. This plays into what we mentioned in the Hedonism section - that pleasures/pains are not sinewave but functions which change over time.

![a](/images/happiness/impurity.jpg)

The main figure that represents this school of thought was Friedrich Nietzsche, which is attributed with the famous quote we have all heard that aptly summarises this:

> "No pain, no gain"

Obviously pain isn't a necessary condition for all pleasure, but it is for some. This applies to both physical and psychological pains. Not every pleasure has a pain that motivates you to seek it, for example you can seredipitously stumble upon the aesthetic pleasure of a flower without planning to do so.

Nietzsche thought that happiness didn't come from escaping every pain we have, but instead cultivating them/using them to gain pleasure, because pains are "flagposts" which draw our attention to what needs to be done. If something is causing you pain, even though that pain is bad, that is a hint that you should change your behavior or otherwise in order to remove it. It is a very life affirmative philosophy which attempts to embrace consciousness and all of its constituents.

This makes sense when you think about the function of hunger, thirst, heat, and tiredness have on motivation: trying to return back to homeostasis by eating, drinking, etc. But rather than the pains just being signals we can use to remove them and get back to neutral, like the Epicureans thought, Nietzsche believed that **the greatest pleasures** came about as a result of not avoiding pains but using them as guides to what needs to be solved. In this way he thinks they are trails to large positive experiences.

Interesting and related to this is the concept in biology called [Hormesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis). Hormesis is when an organism gains a net positive response to a short term stressor. Examples include:
* Exercising causes physiological stress in the short term but larger breathing capacity and improved cardiovascular system function as a result
* Extreme heat/cold stress (ie Saunas/Cryotherapy) are stressful in the short term but have net benefits
* Alcohol/Fermentation potentially has a role here, by being mildly toxic in the short term but beneficial in the long
* Even vegetables are believed to exert their positive effects via hormesis. Plants contain phytonutrients which are toxic to small insects, but are present in such small amounts that humans are able to fight them off and develop a various of beneficial systems to offset the periodic consumption

Some more general [examples](https://gettingstronger.org/about-this-blog/) of hormetism are:
* Attempting to improve eyesight without glasses
* Overcoming psychological challenges
* Improving immune system
* Allergen immunotherapy
* The positive effects of radiation
* Improving [addictions](https://gettingstronger.org/2010/04/overcoming-addictions/)

These are just a few interesting examples that highlight how initially stressful / painful events can result in net gains. Actually the examples above of hormesis are related to biochemical stress, the more general term which captures psychological, and others is [Eustress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress) - meaning "good stress", or for our purposes "good pain". In exercise terminology, the positive response to exercise is called [Supercompensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercompensation). Recently, the popular author Nassim Taleb came up with the term [Antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility) which also attempts to describe the same phenomena unknowingly.

In support of Nietzsche's idea about pains being functional, leading emotion psychologists such as Edwin Locke also agree (2). Edwins research is that *emotions are the form of taking automatic, subconscious value appraisals*. He thinks that every emotion involves a specific type of value appraisal, few being:
* Fear is experienced during a perceived threat to one's life or well-being (or that of a loved one)
* Anxiety is experienced during a perceived threat involves one's self-esteem, and involves more uncertainty over the threat
* Sadness is experienced at the loss of a value
* Depression is a more intense form of sadness involving self-deprecation and a sense of hopelessness
* Anger is experienced when a goal is blocked
* Guilt is experienced when one violates their moral values
* Pleasure is experienced when one has gained or possessed a value
* Pride is experienced during an achievement due to one's own efforts
* Admiration is experienced during the appraisal of another person's positive achievements
* Happiness is the state of non-contradictory joy, and more intense than pleasure

He thinks every emotion has the same pattern (excluding biological imbalances): an object in the world (a thing, person, action, event, idea, memory, or previous emotion) -> cognition (percetion of the object and associations) -> value appraisal (measuring the object by whether some value is being fulfilled or threatened in some way) -> resulting subconscious emotion (which is either a positive or negative state). He even acknowledges that emotions differ in intensity, eg: hate is stronger than disliking. He says the middle stages (cognition -> value appraisal) are automatic and subconscious so what is consciously experienced is object -> emotion. He makes the interesting point that a mood is an enduring emotional state, and it endures because the object (eg a bad boss) is always present, or because causes endure based on memory (eg losing a good job) or rumination (replaying triggering thoughts).

There aren't any extremely actionable takeaways from this section, what we was learnt is that the bellcurve of emotions is a tricky one and sometimes you might want to expose yourself to pains to receive following pleasures (commonsensically: delay gratification). Not all short term pains are bad, and pains are usually a signal to a problem that needs to be solved which can remove the pain, but just make sure you're not doing so at the full exclusion of pleasure. Or even better, the result in removing the pains may result in pleasure gains, and if you get it right, maximising the right negative emotions can lead to much greater pleasure.

# Maximising pleasure
So we've seen that two potential methods for increasing our happiness sum is by minimising pleasure (which fails), and maximising pain (which can indirectly work in particular ways). But the most obvious method we can use and the one which most of us focus all of our efforts on is maximising pleasures / positive experiences.

We've acknowledged that there's a handful of methods we can use to improve our positive experiences:
- Repeat small pleasurable events often
- Focus on large impactful events

But I'm going to add two more:
- Shape our global judgements about our life
- Savoring / Prolonging individual experiences

I'm going to focus on repeatability and savoring first due to their brevity.

### Situation Selection
We have already noted how behavioral habits can be important because they can act as looping experiences which compound. Another thing you could do is modify your **environmental triggers** so you aren't exposed to triggers of bad emotional states, and are exposed to good ones. For example, if you found that going on certain apps or websites made you unhappy, it would be wise to stop doing so. In fact, some cool research suggests that **[situation selection](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/20/preliminary-evidence-that-situation-selection-can-help-us-regulate-our-emotions/)** - doing activities and being places that make you feel good, and avoiding people who make you feel bad, is an effective intervention for reducing negative emotions. But we can also use it to increase the positive.

![situation selection](/images/happiness/selection.jpg)

## Pleasure Events
Although it seems like human experience is infinitely diverse, due to the basic universal biology and evolution we all share, there is a finite list of less than 50 *types* of pleasure events, or positive experiences that we can engage in. Anything we can think of as pleasurable can be captured under this list. If you can think of any others [let me know](https://adamdemirel.com):
* Physical Pleasures
  * Sensory
      * Eating good food
      * Smelling / olfactory pleasures
      * Drinking / hydrating
      * Auditory / sound pleasures (eg music)
      * Visual pleasures / art / vivid colors
  * Biological
      * Itching a scratch
      * Sexual stimulation
      * Thermal comfort
          * Cool weather / body during heat
          * Physical warmth during cool
      * Tactile pleasures / receiving a Massage
      * Tactile Comfort, eg soft fabrics
      * Urination
      * Defecation
      * Approaching sleep during tiredness
  * Physiological Pleasures
      * Feeling energetic / vigilant
      * Exercise high (endorphins)
      * Stimulants (eg caffeine)


* Psychological Pleasures
  * Learning
      * Reading
      * Watching movies / media
  * Love
  * Social pleasures
      * Socialising with people you like
      * Accomplishment / Mastery / Recognition
      * Social approval
      * Laughter / humor
      * Games / Competition / Sports
  * Cleanliness / order
  * Novelty
      * Travelling to new locations
      * Trying new things
      * Browsing the web
  * Financial security
  * Experience of cuteness
  * Being in nature

### The Purpose of Pleasure
When you look over this list, you can see how most if not all serve an evolutionary purpose, even if not immediately evident. I'm not going to explain them all, but just a handful to highlight. The biological needs are obviously important as they reward us for returning to homeostasis. Physiological pleasures are either a hack we have found into a brain chemistry, or endogenous (produced by us) to offset pain. Learning of various sorts is how we acquired solutions to potential survival and reproduction problems by observing what others have done. Love is an emotion that bonds us so that we invest resources in offspring. Social pleasures are complex which form group cohesion so we can take care of eachother and have better odds. Cuteness is experienced so we care for the baby/animal/thing. We are attraacted to novelty and change because of the potential for new rewards in the environment.

This gives us an interesting model to think about pleasures, which makes sense. We evolved to experienced pleasure because it serves an evolutionary function: to motivate and reward us for experiences that increase our odds at survival and reproduction. The same fundamental motivation for nearly everything else. In fact, a norwegian biologist Bjørn Grinde wrote a whole book about trying to use evolution as a guide for living, called [Darwinian Happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinian_Happiness).



<!-- ### purpose of thoughts
- memory -> then emotional response
- affective forecast /prediction / visualisation -> emotional response
in comparison to environmental triggers/cues -> self talk -> emotional response

emotional response -> behavioral response (or extinguishment of) -> feedback loop into A
-- this whole model has a biological substrate,
-- emotional responses may be rewarding or punishing
-- a might operate subconsciously


Your behaviours of what rewards you seek and punishes avoid, are not based on some complex forms of reasoning and analysis, but mere intuition shortly preceding each behaviour in time. -->



## Repeatable Pleasures
So the first method we can use to increase happiness is to increase as many of these pleasures as possible. That can either be by maximising the sensory pleasures as per the Cyrenaics, or we can increase as many psychological pleasures as possible - by socialising, learning, loving, being in nature, and engaging in novel activities.

![a](/images/happiness/repeats.jpg)

## Savoring
The second method that we can use to increase happiness is to prolong individual experiences, that is, take them from an experience smaller in intensity and time and make them more intense and longer is a technique called [savoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoring).

![savoring](/images/happiness/savoring.jpg)

Savoring can be achieved by:
* Being mindful/present/attentive to your current positive experiences
* Anticipating your positive experiences in advance
* Reminscing on positive memories
* Avoiding dampening / "killjoy" thinking about positive experiences, and
* Communicating your positive experiences to others with positive facial expressions. The effect can be bolstered by sharing your positive emotions with others while you have them.

It's also shown that not only does savoring improve positive experiences directly, but also has a bunch of other positive effects: helps build stronger relationships with others, improves mental and physical health, reduce hopelessness, and increases creative problem solving.

Some researchers believe that savoring can be state based (ie about a particular experience) or trait based - a disposition for all experiences. What this suggests is that cultivating trait savoring can have large effects long term. Interestingly, there is also an opposing phenomena to savoring called dampening where you reduce the intensity and duration of positive emotions, which some believed is a personality trait. Research also supports that one of the reasons wealthier people are less happy is due to lower savoring ability ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20483819)). People with lower self esteem also savor less and are more likely to dampen. And Easterners tend to savor less than westerners ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21910543)).

## Big Events
The third method we can use to increase happiness is to focus on big life events. This is an appealing approach because increasing a lot of small pleasures in life doesn't intuitively feel too impactful, and thus most of us are actually drawn away from that in the hopes of attaining some large big pleasure later, as Nietzsche suggested.

![a](/images/happiness/bigpleasure.jpg)

So how do we figure out which pleasure events have the largest effect? One way is that we could observe others/look at happiness narratives, but obviously this would be crude. If we looked over the list and used our intuition - we would probably guess that travelling, gaining wealth, gaining a romantic partner, and accomplishment would have disproportionate effects. I find the idea of success being defined as *the best in world* to be interesting for this reason. Even for something trivial like a video game (as previewed in the great documentary [The King of Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Kong)), you would expect this would cause a great amount of joy /a large sum of psychological pleasure.

Unfortunately there is not any perfect research measuring the curve or experience of all the different pleasures we laid out, but there is some self-report data on how unemployment, marriage, divorse, widowhood, childbirth, and layoff affect happiness [here](https://appen.com/blog/promoting-diversity-and-inclusion-in-the-workplace-appen-hires-over-50-persons-with-disabilities-pwds-lifeatappen/).

![a](/images/happiness/lifeevents.png)

What is shows is that people tend to get a substantial drop in happiness after employment, approaching widowhood, marriage, and after the birth of a child, and a substantial boost in happiness after divorce and layoff.

Other research suggests big positive changes for: starting a new relationship (highest) and gaining employment, starting pregnancy, starting a new educational course, and buying a new house ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17905809)). The events that had the highest negative impacts were ending of relationships, and death of a parent. And other papers echo that the large events are related to marriage, divorce, bereavement, deaths, work, ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289759/)).



### Diminishing Returns
What the chart above demonstrated was the odd fact that a lot of us have heard of, that whether it is a large positive event (such as winning the lottery), or large negative event (like an injury), our reports about our happiness tend to return to a relatively stable baseline after ~5years. People tend to adapt to common large life events by returning to a baseline. But that doesn't discount their effects on our total happiness while they are occurring.

![diminishing returns](/images/happiness/diminishing.jpg)

This is one of the sad facts about human experience and pleasure. The first bite of a meal is great, the last is not great. Or in more general terms, the more we do of something pleasurable, the less enjoyable it becomes. Most of us have experienced this personally in the form of dreaming for something: a product or experience, and once attaining it moving on with life. In this form of diminishing returns, it is what Economists call [Diminishing Marginal Utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Diminishing_marginal_utility).

This makes sense evolutionary as remember that pleasures are rewards for attaining a need, and obviously we cannot be in a constant state of bliss because (a) the need gets satisfied quickly, and (b) if we were constantly experiencing pleasure we wouldn't seek out our needs. This is one of the big critiques of most utopian societies (as [Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer) wrote about).

This returning to baseline after experiencing pleasure (or pain), whether big or small, is what's known as the [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) where like a treadmill you're gaining pleasure but keep returning to the same level of happiness. Obviously this doesn't make pleasures completely pointless to chase, as we mentioned you're still experiencing an increase in happiness before returning to the baseline.

Other research calls this return to baseline the Hedonic Adaptation Prevention Model, which leads us into looking at any ways that it can be prevented. The psychologist [Sonja Lyubomirsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonja_Lyubomirsky) is the leading researcher in this area and covered a lot of it in her book [The How of Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2326098.The_How_of_Happiness). One of the main ideas is that we can prevent adapting to positive experiences by (1) continuing to savor them, and (2) having continuied variety of experiences ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22361725)). Novelty is one of the pleasure events that we mentioned in our list, and it turns out one of the reasons it is so great is that it is the solution to adaptation.

A third solution can be found in the great book with a bad name [Happy Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15803098-happy-money), which is simply to partake in the pleasurable experiences less frequently - this is another mode for preventing adaptation.

![fighting adaptation](/images/happiness/fightingadaptation.jpg)

### Impact Bias
Another sad fact of reality and related bias is the tendency for humans to overestimate the intensity and duration of pleasures (fortunately and pains), what's caleed the [impact bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_bias). This is related to the psychoanalyst Lacan's concept of [Jouissance](https://www.lacan.com/forced.htm) - wher we get a milder "jouissance obtained" in place of the full satisfaction of a "jouissance expected" - so attaining pleasures or fulfilling our desire is never as great as we expect.

On a more macro scale, this reminds me of when you read stories of traditionally successful figures and they often remark at ages 40-50 that they realised that there's no moment of "complete happiness/satisfaction" that you reach, like they expected before they were successful, the ride just continues on. This is both terrifying and enlightening - it doesn't really matter what big events we do or don't get, and the smaller events are within our control. Also, again it doesn't matter if we return to baseline, the pains/pleasure preceding that drop to baseline are still valid experiences, regardless of experiencing some *grand cognitive satisfaction*.

---

## Subjective Wellbeing
As mentioned, one of the four methods to maximise our happiness is to "shape our global judgements about life". What I was referring to their were self-reports of happiness/wellbeing. Measuring happiness in the Psychology literature has often gone by the title '**Subjective Wellbeing** (SWB)' due to the negative connotation the term happiness has.

And just as you would expect, psychologists have tried [operationalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operationalization) happiness - making it as measurable as possible. This is useful for any construct because it means we can standardise it and try to find practical applications for the research. The way they have done this is simply by *asking* people how happy they are. There are two key phenomena they have measured:
1. **Life Satisfaction Reports** - These are the most common type of self-report studied, and the question is almost always verbatim: *"all things considered, how happy are you with your life at the moment on a scale of 1–10?"*
2. **Affective Balance Reports** - these are also self-reports, but rather than trying to capture one's happiness in a single measurement, tries to capture the presence of positive emotions and absence of negative emotions

There are three main ways methods these have phenomena have been measured:
1. Global judgements - used by life satisfaction reports, where a single question tries to summarise one's whole life
2. The Day Reconstruction Method - where the participant fills out a diary of the previous days activities and moods
3. Experience Sampling Method - where participants are messaged at random intervals of the day to record their activity and mood

The validity of these various methods and drawbacks will discussed later. First let's get out of the way what the research says.

How this is important to us is that if we believe that life satisfaction reports are accurate, for instance, one way that we could try to maximise positive emotions is to do the things that make people rate the highest and eliminate the ones that people rate the lowest. This was the benefit of the scientific method that we mentioned at the start - by using large datasets and the scientific method, we can discover the behaviors, beliefs, environments, or variables that lead to happiness.

Thanks in part to the positive psychology movement, recent years have brought a surge of interest in the correlates of subjective well-being. *Self Reporting* is a technical way of saying 'the measurement of asking people'. It is purported to measure subjective well-being, which is the technical name for self-reported happiness.

If you ask people how happy they are on a scale of 1–10, they can self-report a 7 for instance, and this can give a somewhat accurate picture of the state of affairs if you assume that people know how they feel (have the self awareness) and have the ability to attach a number to it. There's no reason to think that we can't do this since we can do a thing called *intensity matching*. Intensity matching is converting between different unrelated mediums. For example, if I ask you "If John 6'2 and Peter is 5'2, and John is as angry as he is tall, how angry is Peter?", you're likely to answer "less angry than John" or something of the sort. It turns out that humans can and do utilise this for all sorts of thinking. People can do a similar thing with happiness.

This has largely been the method of scientists over the last 50 years with life satisfaction research. This has been the fruit of the new science of happiness starting in the 90s (ie positive psychology). What happens is that you ask enough people this question and correlate it with other questions such as how much money they make, whether they are happy with their relationships, how much they sleep, etc. You then find items that correlate highly with people saying they are satisfied with their life and you assume there is some link between the two when there are enough people, via statistical analysis. The factor may not cause happiness, but some sort of association is usually enough to suggest that there is a real relationship we are measuring. If we find out that two things correlate highly, then we can do randomised studies where we compare the two groups and find out whether the thing causes the happiness or whether happiness causes the thing. eg do people who smoke become unhappier or do unhappier people smoke?

### Life Satisfaction
There have been a lot of findings in this field of research. The findings of these studies are quite interesting, and many commonsense notions about happiness appear to be inaccurate. Here is a list of things that do or don't correlate with happiness / unhappiness:

#### Strong Predictors
* [Sleep Quality](https://adamdemirel.com/sleep) ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/live-well-for-less/living-well-index))
* An **Optimistic mindset** in explaining negative setbacks ([ref](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26123.Learned_Optimism))
* The **absence of smoking** cigarettes/quitting smoking improves happiness *significantly* ([ref](https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/26/2/195.abstract))
* **Love and marriage** and happiness ([ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022100031004001)). Romantic relationships can be stressful. Nevertheless, people consistently rate being in love as one of the most critical ingredients of happiness. Married people are happier than people who are single or divorced. However, the casual relations are unclear - it may be that happiness causes marital satisfaction more than martial satisfaction promotes happiness. Perhaps people who are happy tend to have better intimate relationships and more stable marriages, while people who are unhappy have more difficulty finding and keeping mates.
* **[Job satisfaction](https://adamdemirel.com/job-satisfaction)** ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00541-019)). People often complain about their work. Therefore, one might not expect work to be a key source of happiness. But it is. It's not as critical as love or marriage, but job satisfaction has a substantial association with general happiness. Studies also show that **unemployment** has strong negative effects on SWB ([ref](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225510/subjective_wellbeing_employment.pdf)). It's difficult to sort out whether job satisfaction causes happiness or vice versa, but evidence suggests that causation flows both ways.
* Sex life ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/live-well-for-less/living-well-index))
* **Genetics** ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16219116)) - account for about 50% variance (which is a *lot* in happiness research - more than anything else). The best predictor of individuals future happiness is their past happiness. Some people seem destined to be happy and others unhappy, regardless of their triumphs or setbacks. The limited influence of life events is demonstrated with the hedonic treadmill (which I'll talk about further below).
* **Personality** and happiness ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-11667-032), [ref](http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/3_happiness/Steel2008_5FM_and_happiness_psych_bull.pdf)) - with the largest effect being due to *extroversion*, with agreeableness, conscientiousness, self-esteem, and optimism also being strongly related. ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00541-009)) Peoples genetic predispositions account for a substantial portion of the variance in happiness. How? By shaping one's personality and temperament, which are known to be heritable.
* Health of close relatives ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/live-well-for-less/living-well-index))
* Being **sick/disabled** highly correlates with unhappiness (ibid)
* **Debt** and unhappiness ([ref1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16649863), [ref2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167487005000103))

The list of factors that turn out to have fairly strong associations with happiness is surprisingly short. The key ingredients of happiness appear to involve love, work, and genetic predisposition expressed through personality.

#### Moderate Predictors
* **Health** and happiness (~.32) ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-018)). Good health, may not by itself produce happiness because people tend to take good health for granted. May explain why researchers only find a moderate positive correlation between health status and SWB.
* **Religion** and happiness ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-019)), though this may be due to religious attendance and not religious belief ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19142047))
* **Social Activity** and happiness ([ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00501001.x)). Humans are social animals. As such, interpersonal relations *do* appear to contribute to people's happiness. Those who are satisfied with their social support and friendship networks and those who are socially active report above-average levels of happiness. Furthermore, people who are exceptionally happy tend to report greater satisfaction with their social relations than those who are average or low in SWB. People who had deep, substantive convos were happier than those who mostly engaged in small talk.
* Above includes whether you **live alone** and **eat alone** often ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/~/media/Files/S/Sainsburys/living-well-index/Sainsburys%20Living%20Well%20Index%20Wave%204%20Jun%202019%20FV.pdf))

#### Weak Predictors
* There is a positive correlation between **income** and SWB, but its weak (between .12 and .20) ([ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00501001.x)). Though it's high between very low income and unhappiness. In other words, money doesn't make you happier unless you're below the poverty line (can't pay for food, shelter, clothing, and sanitation). For a full exploration see [here](https://adamdemirel.com/job-satisfaction/#section-50).
* **Video game** use in young people improves well being slightly ([ref](https://mindfulnessinschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/video-games-and-wellbeing.pdf))
* **Part-time workers** are very slightly happier than full-time (ibid)
* **Home Ownership** is positively correlated with life satisfaction ([ref](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24719087)) (but more important for females than males) - however, its effect on well-being seems to depend on *income level* (less important for lower income), potentially due to aspiration preferences ([ref](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254420231_Homeownership_and_subjective_well-being)). Some seemingly better research suggests that homeownership improves *housing satisfaction* but not life satisfaction ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11205-010-9607-6)) and that they might actually not be happier at all due to spending their time in worse ways ([ref](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1877163)). Also having a **home loan** has a negative effect on life satisfaction ([ref](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24719087)).
* Your **country** weakly predicts happiness (<.10) - ranging from 6.5 (for brazil) - 7.5/10 (for finland) ([ref](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/)).

![a](/images/happiness/swbbycountry.png)

#### Neutral Predictors
* **Physical Attractiveness** is unrelated to happiness ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1995-40426-001))
* **Intelligence** is unrelated to happiness ([ref](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2143374))
* **Parenthood** is unrelated to happiness ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-00473-000)). Compared to childless couples, parents worry more and experience more marital problems. Apparently, the good and bad aspects of parenthood balance each other out. The evidence indicates that people who have children are neither more nor less happy than people without children (Argyle, 2001).
* **Gender** does not correlate with happiness ([ref](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327582ijpr0403_7?journalCode=hjpr20)) - men and women are equally happy. (this is a separate measurement from depression incidence)
* **Age** is not correlated with happiness ([ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691618765171)) (less than 1% of the variance) and has been found to be consistently unrelated.

As you can see, quite a number of factors that you might expect to be influential appear to bear little or no relationship to general happiness.

### Issues with SWB / Conclusions about SWB
> Happiness is a single retrospective judgement based on memory/emotional state at ONE point in time (aka a meme!).

We must be cautious about drawing inferences about the causes of happiness. The available data are correlational, not causal. I don't think the causal direction is the main offender for this field of research though.

The first minor takedown comes from **hedonic adaptation**. Research on SWB indicates that people often adapt to their circumstances. Hedonic adaption occurs when the mental scale that people use to judge the pleasantness-unpleasantness of their experiences shifts so that their neutral point, or baseline for comparison, changes. Evidence suggests people adapt more slowly to negative events than to positive events. The idea is that the effect of big events on wellbeing is quite fleeting as humans are adaptable, suggesting that we have to depend on the non-event correlates like genes, relationships, etc, mentioned above.

I think the major takedown of the research is the following.

Two types of measures: *global evaluations* ("all things considered, how do you feel about your life?"), and *local evaluations ("have you experienced specific positive or negative emotions the previous day?")* are used to measure happiness, based on self report. In both situations, the person being questioned is making a **single, retrospective judgement/report about the past** (whether it's a day ago, year, or life). This essentially depends on the individual to firstly accurately remember, remember in sufficient detail, and then calculate their experiences accurately to make a correct summary - what's called **remembered utility**. Psychology has shown that there are a lot of quirks in humans ability to do this, and we are terrible at framing. These are called F*raming Effects* (see dan gilbert's research for all the issues).

The idea that you can make a single retrospective judgement from a single point in time, and do it accurately, is obviously faulty. A much better alternative would be if we could tell how people actually feel moment to moment, and then we can see whether what they report is truly how they felt. This was (3) mentioned at the start of this article - **We can study how people feel about their lives moment to moment. This is called experienced utility**. This will be the subject of part 3 of this series.

 experienced self / esm:
We can study how people feel about their lives from moment to moment.


Your life does not exist in some sort of capsule where you can experience your Total pleasures and pains at each point, and trying to maximise pleasures completely or minimise pains completely is a futile endeavour, as you can do neither.

- Life (meaning the totality of thoughts and emotional experiences) is predominantly the lump sum/totality of single events that we do repeatedly/repeat. (ie ferris “life is the sum of the small things that we do repeatedly”)


feb 2019: - secret to 100% wellbeing: no coffee, no porn, no dairy or choc, no sugar, no supps, kale shake, jumprope, meditation, teethbrush

31/01/17: experience sampling method still being problematic due to it relying on self report.


- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method

What you can control is what you do at each small interval in time. “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.” - Steve Jobs

Goal Setting is a way to verbalise your intuitions of what you think will make you the happiest at each point. Its probably good to do this just to have a concrete anchor to refer back to for justifying the aversive consequences of your behaviour, like work.

There are three sorts of phenomena that you can control in an attempt to improve the overall quality of your life: your brain chemistry, your thought patterns, and your environment.
- The main determinants of brain chemistrys effects on life quality are: serotonin transporter speed (gxe determined), amount of substrate in system (nutrition determined – complex dietary interactions and amino acids etc), not depleting ones neurotransmitters through excessive stimulation (porn, internet, etc), environmental triggers which cause the production and release of neurotransmitters (and absence of negative ones. See below).
- The main determinants of thought patterns: sensory stimulus in immediate environment (so control your environment – the people you surround yourself with, the activities you spend your time on, and your work and living location), and your explanatory style (seligman).
- The main determinants of your environment are: x

The more that an activity is done repeatedly, the more value it has in determining the quality of your life. This likely encapsulates and explains the measurements of subjective wellbeing and why job satisfaction is the #1 correlate with life satisfaction, because you spend a majority of your life working (and sleeping).

The concept of small wins is also valuable to motivate positive habit formations, as it demonstrates that larger and larger rewards can accrue over time with small but regular behaviours.

So basically there are sets of events which give you pleasure, and sets of events which cause you pain. It is a bit more complex, because some events last longer than others, have more intensity, and have the ability to cause reward by surpassing the pain, or have the ability for diminishing returns, etc.

Humans essentially have a set point for wellbeing that they return to relatively quickly after an event of pain or pleasure, which renders the events only moderately valuable, but still worth pursuing. What is a great endeavour I think is trying to modify the setpoint to a different level. I think this set point is titled hedonic tone in psychology.

Happiness is still more illusory than these previous concepts because of Kahneman's distinction between experienced utility and remembered utility.  ---

esm is when you have a handheld pc, and several times a day it asks a few questions like your location, activities engaged in before the prompt, whom you were interacting with, current subjective experience (the extent that you feel the presence or absence of various feelings with affective category descriptors/adjectives: like anger, hapy, worried, tired, impatient, deressed 0-6 not at all to very much)

# MINIMIZING PAINS
- minimising pain - see my pains list
  - minimising desires
  - minimising desire / downshifting


## MINIMISE PSYCHOLOGICAL PAINS
- Minimise psychological pains by losing self-reflective consciousness.
- Psychological pains are not only taken at the present, but also past and future – thus more enduring. And more important to people who are more reflective and live inside their mind like myself. Accounts for sadism, memories, expectations, psych desires.
  - Forms: escapism, stoicism, buddhism, alcohol, flow, zapffe, schopenhauer sublimation, terror management theory
  - Therefore, escapism, nietzsche, pleasureseeking arent all opposed but linked in a metamodernist perspective of oscillation, but the problem is ive been sacrificing circumstances at the expense of pleasure/flow.
- Stoicism idea: “psych pain is inevitable, psych suffering is optional”. Then what do we do or desire, bc desire is basically synonymous with pain and if we don't desire then there's no reason to even eat or live. Needs to demarcate its limits. Also, as long as suffering is in your mind, you suffer regardless of opinion, there's no illusion of choice. To say it's optional is to say you can choose not to have those thoughts, which you cannot choose to force out of your head – but you can enter non self reflective consciousness via flow. So stoicism amounts to escapism.
- Flow is focusing attention in a consistent manner. The perk of it is that it is infinitely renewable (like movies, chess, pool, socialising, internet etc) and also easily obtained, as opposed to improving circumstances which require more effort and pain.
- The problem with flow/escapism is that it is also fleeting, there are inter-flow gaps where you realise your poor circumstances and experience psychological pain. And we can't constantly be in flow.


[This](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/negative-emotions-key-well-being/) interesting article points out various interesting research on how attempts to suppress negative thoughts actually make them more present, and so the key is to accept them. This is interesting but this does not support the idea that we should endure negative thoughts, they are still intriscally bad, what it acknowledges is perhaps a better way to mitigate their affect is indirect - by accepting them.


## MINIMISE SENSORY PAINS
- Aka negative hedonism, epicureanism
- Sensory means relates to organs: tacticle (massage/sex/itch), visual (film/art), auditory (music), gustatory (food), olfactory (scent). Not robust enough, see 1.2. Taken only at the present – fleeting.
- This would be sufficient (and we could live completely in the present, but thats not the case) if humans didn't experience psychological pains (enduring) such as memories or expectations, psychological desires for girlfriend/compassion/friends/job, boredom etc.




# Eliminating Pains
- Flow theory / flow psychology
- "problems"
- https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-23653-008 systematic phenomenology?
- Nietzches idea that pains act as a flagpost to what needs our attention (from school of life)
- Evolution of negative thoughts - negativity bias
  - * Humans (and evo psych) are merely the result of the irrational process of survival and reproduction in genes (will to survive). Pleasure evolved as a reward for the avoidance of pain. How much of a pessimistic or optimistic bias we have when ruminating about the past and future is largely conditioned and a result of thinking habits/patterns which can be changed. Do further research.(read buddhas brain) So “change negative thinking about how the subject feels about themselves, about others and the future” (positive psychology) because belief/disbelief influences the future and the subjects willingness to avoid pain (learned helplessness).
  - * I previously thought the result of evolution was that psych pains always outweighed pleasures regardless of circumstances, but now realise thats not true after seeing blue zones. So the result is that existence is a mistake only for THOSE who arent born wealthy, attractive or raised to be intelligent. The good news is that one can be all these 3 things with enough effort.
  - counterargument: 19.05.18: we tend to remember positive memories longer than negative ones https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658210902791665 from happy money p15 - This is not to say tht all negativity evaporates from our memories. Particularly negative experiences can sometimes become manigified in memories review mirror.
- life is constant suffering: Schopenhauer + Zapffe
- Ecapism
- Alcohol - liquid asceticism, depressants
- Presentism
- Lobotomy
- Rumination & unhappiness, dan gilbert paper
- Meditation / mindfulness - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness * (look for the science behind it)

- Pains: Physical (hunger[recurring], tiredness[recurring], thirst[recurring]), psychological (social -> (fomo, loneliness, empathy, rejection), regret, boredom, depression -> (perceived lack of control (solution cbt), real lack of control))
  - 04.05.17: - had the thought today that what i mean by control in my seligman theory is have the capacity to -change-.
- suffering is optional

# Optimize base level / Hedonic Tone
- Hedonic Tone / emotional complexion
  - neurohedonism
- Cig biology etc
- Sleep


“- CONSIDER rewriting my ethical theory in terms of motivation being neuropsychological and life goals as maximising dopamine output // and how the traditional attitudinal/sensory distinction was just mindless intellectual posturing and arbitrary categories.”

I'd like to title this theory neurohedonism, and as it stands, I dont think the word has ever been used.
- I've concluded that all of the theoretical distinction collapses between attitudinal and sensory hedonism are irrelevant to the central dogma of hedonism which modern biology is naturally suggesting but nobody has seemed (as far as I know) to have explicitly stated in hedonistic theory – that pleasure, whether sensory or attitudinal, is good, and it is the **expression of particular neurotransmitter activity.**

- Thus, pleasure is the **expression of particular neurotransmitters and pain is the expression of others.**

- From my current understanding, the pleasure neurotransmitters which should be sought to be maximised are Dopamine, Serotonin, Norepinephrine, opoids, and maybe dynorphin, epinephrine
- From my current understanding, the pain neurotransmitters are Substance P (related to pain signalling, mentally and physically), and glucocticoids (cortisol in humans which is the stress response).
- The normative question then becomes how to maximise some neurotransmitters and reduce others? This is where I think modern science finally usurps philosophy in ethics as it has in all the other fields
- With a proposition such as “the more of certain transmitters, the better/more good/higher the value of the experience” one can easily see how quantifiable/falsifiable replies to objections of locke and bentham can be produced.
- I feel as if this could be extremely influential in political policies
- Another reformulation would be “the more of particular neurotransmitters the life contains, the better the life”
- So for objections like at the end of Feldman “the repugnant response” or whatever that a life containing a lot of small pleasures and nothing else is adverise, perhaps its because its speaking in abstract language like the rest of hedonistic theory has and missed that perhaps having small static levels of particular positive neurotransmitters like dopamine doesnt offset dysthemia or small persistent static levels of negative ones which produce boredom or pain

* There is a handful of Neurotransmitters which are implicated in well-being:
- Only Dopamine, Serotonin, and Norepinephrine out of the ~100 neurotransmitters seem to be implicated in depression. Epinephrine is also implicated in wakefulness. And Glucocorticoids in modulating the stress response.
* The value/happiness of one's life is determined by the balance of the relevant neurotransmitters.
* Keep in mind the human brain is plastic and is changing every second. Fire together wire together.


* The main factors that contribute to the balance of the relevant neurotransmitters are:
– Whether or not you have the **depression gene** ((1) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12161658 (Technically, The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the promotor region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), not the gene itself. (1b) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12869766  – This paper showed that individuals who carried a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) were more vulnerable to developing depression following exposure to stressful life events.. (1c) http://brainworldmagazine.com/the-new-new-genetics-gets-practical/) Stressful life events were measured as employment, financial, housing, health, and relationship stressors.), in conjunction with **stressful early life** events which increases likelihood of depression (Gene x Environment interaction). This explains why stressful events lead to depression in some people but not in others.

- Massages increase dopamine and serotonin, and decrease cortisol (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162447)
– Coffee increases Serotonin transmission, but you build up a tolerance and may have withdrawals without it.
- Take fish oil daily, as deficiency in omega 3 can result in mood disorders (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16741195)
- The ability to delay gratification is the #1 predictor of future success (?). Interestingly, the ability to delay gratification is mediated by serotonin levels (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18434531).
- Taking antidepressant drugs (SSRI, SNDRI etc.) to off-set the negative brain chemistry consequences (depression) of stressful early life events
- Not depleting one's reward system through excessive porn or masturbation (http://www.yourbrainonporn.com/adolescent-brain-meets-highspeed-internet-porn)

# Summary
handful of strategies to go about improving our happiness:
- minimise as many physical pains as possible
- selectively add many physical and psychological pains that are *impure*, to increase the total pleasure
- maximise as many physical pleasures as possible: (list)
- maximise as many psychological pleasures as possible: swb and experienced self, socialise as much as possible
- try to maximimise single large events that causing looming psychological pleasures
- minimise as many pains as possible: meditation, and flow state, eliminate rumination
- make life meaningful? by x:
- increase your hedonic tone / resting happiness level by experimenting with various NeuroCosmetics



- A circumstantial improvement of ones life would mean curating circumstances which make pleasures (psych and sens) most likely to occur, pains least likely, maximise flow if necessary and minimise inter-flow states of rumination. A sort of self-help/self-sufficiency theory of happiness.
- Some people have good circumstances naturally (rich and attractive) while others have to work hard towards them.
