 I wholly agree that by observing human behaviour, you can accurately arrive at the **pleasure principle**: that most or all of human behaviour can be explained by their need to avoid pain, and to seek pleasure (which is motivated by pain).

# Intro
> If you don't get what you want, you suffer; If you get what you don't want, you suffer; Even when you get exactly what you want, you still suffer because you can't hold on to it forever. Your mind is your predicament. It wants to be free of change. Free of pain, free of the obligations of life and death. But change is law and no amount of pretending will alter that reality. - Socrates

The purpose of this essay is to attempt to unravel and answer the age old ethical question "what is happiness?" and in doing so converge on an accurate model of what the desirable life looks like.

Each of us has roughly 36,000 days to do something worthwhile with our limited time and use it in ways which make us feel good rather than bad. An hour read here could hopefully nudge how you spend a portion of those days.

![sadf](/images/happiness/timemonths.png)

What is Happiness? This is probably one of the most important questions of this essay. To be able to attain something or seek after it, you must have some idea of what it is. What I'm referring to by happiness will become clearer throughout the read, but at its core it's a value system. By [value system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiology) I mean a hierachy of preferences which can be used to inform decisions.

The methods of measuring happiness will differ depending on the area of study, but they all share the same common theme of trying to find an optimal set of outcomes.

> There was a wonderful paper that asked what happiness means at different points in history and in different cultures. And oddly enough, historically, happiness means **good fortune**. It doesn't mean the emotional response to having good fortune, it means good fortune itself. A happy person is a lucky person. It's not that a happy person is a lucky person, what it means to be happy is that you're lucky. This was the dominant definition pretty much everywhere and in modern cultures this definition has been replaced. ([1](https://youtu.be/hjACfaEh9BM?t=1378), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23599280))

But although this linguistic definition was used, it is not of much use to us because it is not actionable and if anything it is passive. The importance of this analysis and the modern happiness research is uncovering things that empower our decisions and alter our lives in large and small ways. So beyond good fortune, happiness must mean something else, and that something else is best defined and introduced by the ancient greek hedonists, which I will cover below.

Given the time I've spent researching this field, there seems to be three methods used in attempting to figure out what happiness is:
* Happiness Stories
* The scientific method
* Self experimentation

## Happiness Stories

The first and default method that most people rely upon in attempting to form a happiness model about the world is to observe and talk to other people. This can take the form of reading narratives, watching narratives, or simply talking to others.

Whether or not this is a reliable method is questionable, but what is useful is that these folk theories may give us hints about which areas to look further into or new ideas to test (via the scientific method and our own self experimentation).

## The Scientific Method

The second method that we can use is the scientific method. That means using a systematic set of observations as an attempt to quantify and arrive at answers which go beyond a single person, and in a more standardised manner. Such tools are valuable because they can overcome biases / blind spots individuals may have by using [larger datasets of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). There are a handful of scientific tools that can be used - questionnaires, brain scans, facial expressions, and others. As you will see, the simple questionnaire has dominated a lot of the happiness research.

We are lucky that we now no longer need to rely on introspecting or making conjectures about happiness, but have the ability to peruse the large body of literature on the subject.

## Self Experimentation & Self Awareness

The third method is what people use informally, which is relying on their own personal experience as a guide to what makes them happy and unhappy. This is how most people live their lives - reacting to immediate feedback in their environment and deciding what feels good and what feels bad, and ideally changing their behavior accordingly.

The main drawback of this is that we often [lack awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion) into what makes us feel good and bad, and even if we know we don't usually crystallize in language which is helpful for deciding we want more or less of it.

But again, obviously this is helpful as an imperfect but valuable tool and is also the final metric we use. Who cares what the research says if our individual exprience is the opposite? I agree, but what's useful is that science and happiness stories might provide us with ideas to self experiment with to get our own first-hand data.

# Ancient Greek History
The main type of happiness story I will cover is historical stories. Movies and fictional books are of less structure and use here. Obviously there are many happiness stories out there, narratives going back 1000 years in many cultures. Furtunately a lot of them can be captured under a handful of patterns. I think the important stories to discuss are a few of the Ancient Greek schools of thought, with the three most influential being *Epicureanism, Cyrenaicism*, and *Stoicism*. I think it is interesting that they are all related close in space and time and had opposing schools of thought to eachother, and it allows us to extract out the shared pattern.

There's a lot that can be said about each of these three schools, but I'm going to give a quick overview of three schools below as I don’t believe any account of happiness would be complete without covering them in some basic detail. I'm aware that there are other schools of thought which are classified as ancient but equally as influential, such as Buddhism. I am limiting myself to the Ancient Greeks here, as I will discuss Buddhism and others which are worth noting in their own sections at later points.

Interesting enough, even the most simple of organisms, the *Amoeba*, seems to display a "pain-like" and "pleasure-like" response, moving closer and feeding off of nearby foods and light, and avoiding noxious chemicals and other objects ([4](https://www.britannica.com/science/nervous-system)). And the amoeba is believed to be related to the earliest forms of life 800million years ago! So the motivation of organisms to be pleasure seekers and pain avoiders it not a new phenomena.

// place drawing of aemoeba

The question of how to be “happy” or live a happy life has been a question plaguing humans since time immemorial. Throughout most of animal history, animals would use their immediate environment as a guide to their behaviour — they would live their life completely immersed in each moment, responding to threats of danger and seeking food to keep themselves alive long enough to replicate their genes.


But at an unbeknown point, later humans developed enough sentience and freedom to begin to ask *how they could be better*. They began to ask *what should I do with this finite amount of time that i’m endowed?*

// small circle big circle

The ancient Greeks had a bit to say on this question, but unfortunately, their answers are quite crude and fall short on a few points. I am going to do my best to exclude details of the founding figures lives and principles which are not overtly relevant to answering the questions set out. To give one such example of a type of point I could repeatedly make is that Epicurus (discussed below) was the founder of a famous ‘Garden’ — a kind of Ashram, where he was the *guru*. The fact that he occupied a position of high prestige in a hierarchy like this *could* have had an influence on his well-being. But he never discusses it, and is likely unaware of it. I will not discuss such obvious confounds. Instead, I will focus merely on what they have attempted to communicate as principles to embody. So, what are the relevant principles that Epicurus emphasised?

## Epicureanism
![epicurus](/images/happiness/epicurus.jpg)

> "The acquisition of riches has been for many men, not an end, but a change, of troubles." -Epicurus

Epicureanism (3) is the school of thought founded on the writings of the individual Epicurus. Epicurus is considered a **Hedonist**, an important term which this essay could also be labelled arguing for. The popular culture usage of the word hedonism usually refers to *decadent hedonism*, which is more related to the indulgence of Cyrenaicism as you will see. A lot of scholars effortfully defend Epicureanism from falling under this same label.

There are two principles to Epicureanism: the first is that the *removal* of basic physical needs and desires results in the happiest state possible. That small list of needs are simple needs required for survival, what he called "basal desires", and include the need to sleep, to eat, to drink, and to avoid physical pains. He believed that once you removed the pain that comes with those basic needs (resulting in what he calls *static pleasures*), you have reached what he calls an [ataraxic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia) state — meaning *freedom from desire and discomfort*, a neutral state without pains or pleasures which is the peak of happiness. In his view, "barely bread and water could yield the peak of pleasure". Summarised simply, **happiness is freedom from pain and pleasure**.

The second principle is the importance of friendship to happiness. Although not a purely physical need, he deemed it necessary and thought that it is only through close friends that freedom from anxiety and "peace of mind" is possible.

Whether or not either of these is true, what he understood is that desire results from a particular deficiency, and that pleasure is the result of satisfying said deficiency. Epicurus refers to the pleasure that's the result of removing a pain a *static pleasure*, and scholars call it a *negative pleasure* (opposed to a *positive pleasure* which results from adding pleasure on top of a neutral state, or *kinetic pleasure* as epicurus calls it). Positive pleasure is pleasure which is the result of doing something that doesn't remove a biological desire, such as drinking alcohol. One of the main reasons that he thought negating desire is more preferable than the adding pleasures is because he believed that the latter leads to the further desire for more pleasures, which if cannot be sated leads to pain. Epicurus wrote his views in large part as a reaction to the Cyrenaics, which emphasised the *addition* of physical pleasures.

Epicureanism in its summarised for is that there are natural desires which are necessary for the maintenance of life, and these desires manifest as bodily discomforts, which when resolved result in happiness. These natural desires are separate and more important than the other unecessary and trivial desires.

This reasoning is quite simple, also quite sophisticated. His argument is that the removal of mental and physical pains is the goal of life, because once we remove them, we no longer desire pleasure or the removal of pain. Everything we are motivated to do is to achieve freedom from psychological pain (like fear) and physical pain (like hunger), and once we do this we don't feel the need to continue seeking something which is absent to add to our lives. In concrete terms: **We only have the need for pleasure when we feel a pain, but whenever we do not feel pain then we no longer need pleasure**.

### The problems with Epicureanism
There are two issues with epicureanism, one minor and one major.

#### Duration Neglect
The less severe first problem is that he didn't believe that longer pleasures were superior to shorter ones. If you accept that pleasure is good and pain is bad, obviously the more pleasure and the less pain you experience the better. Failing to acknowledge this is what psychologists call [duration neglect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duration_neglect), which is actually a common bias but is experientially naive. Obviously the duration is important.

#### Neglecting Psychological Pleasures & Pains
The major problematic aspect of Epicureanism is that although he acknowledges pleasure being the result of removing physical pains and desires, he doesn't give any weight at all to psychological pains and desires, or pleasure (beyond friendship).

As we saw, he argued that once you remove the physical pains, you are in a state of neutrality and contentness, but this is clearly incorrect as the absence of physical pains doesn't imply the absence of psychological pains. I agree that the removal of physical pains is relatively simple, but not so simple to eradicate all psychological pains such as sadness, anger, boredom, fear, etc, which can still be present in the absence of physical pains. Time needs to be filled with something, and it can't be completely filled with removing physical needs, because such needs are finite. What will result is boredom or psychological pains.

You can satisfy all of your basal desires but still live an unhappy life due to the many psychological pains that could be present. So the crux of the issue is that he is excluding a list of mental pains that have the ability to affect our happiness.

Additionally, he acknowledges the importance of friendship to removing psychological pains but ignores all other psychological pains and pleasures. This leads him into a contradictory position: on the one hand he emphasis a value system only of physical pains and pleasures, yet makes a single except for friendship. If he admits that there exists such things as psychological pains (like anxiety) which are distinct from physical pains, which friendship can remove, then he must leave open the possibility for all sorts of other psychological pains and pleasures. Then in doing so acknowledge that the removal of these is just as important as removing physical.

We saw that his reason for ignoring pleasures unecessary for survival was due to their riskiness of attainment, but the desire for non basic needs to be satisfied also have the ability to provide pleasure and is potentially pleasure missed. He is also making the assumption that the pain associated with not attaining the future pleasures outweighs the pleasure gained from partaking in them minus the pain of not attaining them.

These are the reasons that although epicureanism provides some important take aways regarding happiness which I will summarise shortly, cannot be relied upon entirely and warrants further research.

## Cyrenaicism

Epicurus' school of thought that the absence of pain is happiness is what's known as **negative hedonism** (negative meaning removal). In contrast, Cyrenaicism is a school of thought that is considered **positive hedonism**, meaning the addition of pleasures. These two schools are considered diametrically opposed, and the Epicureans were a reaction to the Cyrenaics.

The positive hedonists advocated a lifestyle which aimed to maximise pleasurable experiences. The major proponent of positive hedonism was an ancient greek philosopher named [Aristippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristippus) who lead a school of thought named the Cyrenaic school.

![aristippus](/images/happiness/aristippus.jpg)

Aristippus believed physical pleasures beyond a sated state, such as eating extravagant food, were of more importance than mental pleasures (such as 'knowledge' which the greeks also focused on). His argument was that sensory pleasures were of more importance than psychological pleasures due to them being more intense, because they are visceral.

He also believed that physical pleasures, what he called sensory pleasures, should be more sought after due to the higher ease and certainty of them being acquired than the distance experiences which result in psychological pleasure, such as mastery of a skill.

He believed that happiness consisted in gorging oneself with as many physical pleasures as one could - particularlty eating, drinking alcohol, and sex. This is the popular culture conception of hedonism nowadays. These pleasures can also be described as **pleasures of the senses**, in opposition to **pleasures of the mind**.

### The Problems with Cyrenaicism
Besides Cyrenaicism being the typical view of *hedonism* that most people associate the pursuit of pleasure with, and thus giving hedonism a negative connotation, there are a few other issues.

#### Duration neglect of mental pleasures
His argument about the uncertainty of future psychological pleasures is understandable once placed in his historical context - written at a time of war and short life expectancy, thus a perspective of scarcity. When life expectancy is relatively secured by a modern lifestyle, this is less uncertain.

Although he acknowledges that sensory pleasures are more intense, his approach is imprudent and doesn't consider the duration of psychological pleasures, which could lead to a larger hedonic aggregate - a higher total sum of pleasure over time. Physical pleasures are only experienced in the present, whereas psychological ones are exist in the past, present, and future, even if less intense.

So in summary, Aristippus advocated maximising physical pleasures, and cared little for avoiding pain or maximising psychological pleasures. We're starting to see a pattern here.

## Stoicism
The other negative hedonist school of thought which aims to minimise painful experiences were the [Stoics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism), lead by the individual Zeno.

![zeno](/images/happiness/zeno.jpg)

The Stoics wanted to live a life of peace and quiet, similar to the Epicureans. They thought that the addition of any sensory pains or sensory pleasures would disrupt their mental tranquility. But Epicureanism has little theory developed in way of mental pains like the Stoics do, and the Stoic form of *Ataraxia* includes both psychological pleasures and pains, and thereby becomes more encompassing if one considers psychological pains such as *desire, boredom, hatred, guilt*, or any of the other multitude of negative mental states or emotions, as we discussed in the issues with Epicureanism.

To counterpoint — take an ataraxic state in Epicureanism: all physical pains have been removed, but now the subject is theoretically existing in a state of boredom. Would it make sense to say that a whole life lived in boredom but with the absence of pain is a happy life? Ofcourse not. But it wasn’t completely commonsense for the Greeks to think of the mind as producing pains back then, usually only the environment. So the Stoics have the added advantage of realising that our mind itself may be a source of pleasure or pain, and this is aptly emphasised in the quote —

> “We are not troubled by things but the opinion which we have of things.” — Epictetus

They believed that both pains and pleasures disrupt mental peace and tranquility, and this led them to withdraw from the world and engage in tranquil meditation - a sort of voluntary negation of psychological pains and pleasures.

The stoics were principally very similar to Buddhist philosophy / ascetics, aiming to eliminate psychological pains. They both aimed for a life of peace which was free of tribulation or troubled emotions (ataraxia), a state which equates to Epicurus' notion of static pleasures.

### The problem with Stoicism
The same issue with the other schools also occurs with stoicism, that is, they have taken one extreme form on the hedonism axis, in this case - minimising all psychological pain and pleasure, and excluded the others. Just like the Epicureans neglected all psychological pleasures and pains, and just like the Cyrenaics neglected all psychological pains, so do the Stoics neglect all psychological pleasures. But the Stoics do have the advantage over Epicureanism that they acknowledge psychological states.

# Hedonism
Though all three schools fall short on one glaring point, which is obvious to anybody living in the 21st century: **pleasure is not happiness, and pain is not unhappiness**. The reason this is so is mostly to do with **duration**. If you are eating an enjoyable meal and experiencing pleasure, you may say you are happy, but that is merely a *report of your current experience*. If you said this and then lived the rest of your life in pain, it would be queer to state that you lived a happy life. Does that then make happiness about the **quantity** of pleasures and pains, such that a life with *more* pleasure than pain is a happier life? If you include mental pleasures and mental pains, some figures such as the *psychological hedonist* Fred Feldman would argue so (but he calls them *attitudinal pleasures and pains* rather than mental — because they are attitudes you have about the world.) To what extent you need pleasure or the absence of pain in this theory os ambiguous, but what is obvious, is that pleasure is positive and pain is negative (as an evaluation), and although they may or may not make you happy or unhappy, I can agree with this: **The first premise of hedonism is that pleasure is positive and pain is negative; the more pleasure you experience the better, the less pain the worse**. And this is what all three schools have in common despite their shortcomings, they are evaluations of pleasure and pain. To demonstrate the *positivity or negativity* of a stimuli, all that is required is to do is to compare them side by side and *choose which is more preferable*.


This is where the first basic divide is made between pleasure and pain. “Propositional Attitudes” (attitudinal evaluations as per Feldman) are always entailed by Physical Pleasures like eating and Physical Pains like being inflicted with a wound — that’s what make their physical sensations Pleasurable or Painful. It is only because an attitude is taken *about* a sensation of pleasure or pain. BUT, propositional attitudes of pleasure and pain need not necessarily entail a physical sensation — it may be about a set of events in the *past (via memory)* or the *future (via mental forecasting)*, or even about a set of events perceived in the present — such as the pleasure taken at the perception of an artwork (which as a stimuli has a neutral state on us experiencing sensory pleasures or sensory pains). Thus, all physical pleasures and physical pains are based in the *present* but not all attitudinal pleasures and attitudinal pains are (called mental pleasures and mental pains henceforth) — they may be of the past or the future. This opens up a whole new avenue of pleasures such as masochism, social pleasures, romantic pleasures, of accomplishment, recognition, service, fame. This opening of pandoras box of pleasure and pain which is the mind is what I will call **pleasures of the mind**.

**The second premise of hedonism is that pleasure is the only intrinsic value, rendering a life without pleasure worthless**. One may hold values such as knowledge of value, but consider a life full of knowledge without mental pleasure or pain — it is neutral, it’s not preferable over anything (preference is essentially what *value* is!) In comparison, consider a life full of pleasure without knowledge. By using this dialectical reasoning, any additional value trait with the absence of pleasure can be seen lesspreferable than pleasure.

Insummary:
(1) Pleasures and pains can be split into **pleasures of the senses**, and **pleasures of the mind**.
(2) The Epicureans believed that **removing pains of the senses** equalled happiness.
(3) The Cyrenaics believed that **adding pleasures of the senses** equalled happiness.
(4) The Stoics believed that **removing pains of the mind** equalled happiness.

Note: I know you’re thinking, “who believed adding pleasures of the mind equals happiness?” — the answer is in some later posts.

(5) Although it’s up for debate which view is correct, what all three views had in common is their view in **hedonism**.
(6) **The first premise of hedonism** is that pleasure is positive and pain is negative; the more pleasure you experience the better, the less pain the worse.
(7) **The second premise of hedonism** is that pleasure is the only intrinsic value, rendering a life without pleasure worthless.
(8) The intuitive critique to hedonism is it’s most obvious shortcoming: **pleasure is not happiness, and pain is not unhappiness** (arguably).
Which leads us into our next series of posts.

summarised: **pleasure is the only intrinsic good, pain is the only intrinsic bad. The more pleasure a life contains, and the less pain, the better the life is.**

![green up arrow red down arrow](/images/happiness/updown.png)

I buy this definition and I will argue why throughout, but the main reason is that if you define pleasure and pain broadly enough, eg in the sense that pleasure is "positive emotions" and pain is "negative emotions", then there is no other value that a life can contain that would be comparable. These states by definition are desirable and aversive, and even if people sacrifice these states in the short term (eg in the case of delaying gratification), they are doing so for better states later in time. So given this outline, the mathematically best way to live a better life is to increase the total amount of pleasures and reduce the total amount of pains. Philosophers call the atomic unit of pleasure a [hedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus) and economists call them [utils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility).

and benthams principles here

- Pleasure and pain are not merely physical sensations, but mental states taken about physical sensations, events in the world, beliefs, and memories also. (See

- the pleasure response isnt a sinewave! 1 or 0! its a function. Eg see alcohol chart. (time x axis, hedonic tone y axis. peaks shortly and later drops) (or university where you have the oscillating pleasure of a novel environment and socialising with friends, with a big drop after 4 yr  bachelors and financial debt recovery )
  - a very basic example is the sexual response cycle where your intensity of arousal goes from baseline to high, and then peaks in an orgasm before dropping back down.
Or fapping = peak pleasure cumming, then post = low energy, fatigue, no libido. X axis= pain/pleasure. Y axis = time.

success 29.07.17: - Had the idea that one form that 'success' can take is being *the best in the world* at something. I got the idea from watching the king of kong documentary. This form of success also seems to be reflected in a lot of other things which I have observed. Like world barista championships. Sports chamionships.. Etc.
-- eg rephrase to something along the lines of "some could view success as being aworld class performer"



### Habits
habits (in comparison to swb single retro judgement): > Habits optimize for recursive emotional responses. Habits of thoughts (memories and forecasts) and behaviours

CONCLUSION >> So the best way to live is to find ways in which you can improve your circumstances (like working) that are combined with escapism (like flow) so when you experience inter-flow rumination, you feel less bad and have the means (like money) to experience more pleasure? >> Thus, still chase pleasures and minimise pains, but not at the expense of improved circumstances which is most important. Also, seek flow as much as possible.

Our life is a sum of the small activities that we do repeatedly. (13.07.17: aka habits)
>> I think why all of my other theories got this premise wrong is because humans have a tendency to think globally in the whole scale of life, and not linearly that life is a secession of discrete events. (This point was raised in before sunset that he mentions how crazy it is that this is our life that we are living right now.) (“Tomorrow will be like today. Life wastes itself whilst we are preparing to live. - Ralph Waldo Emerson”)

- After all my hedonism theorism, ive concluded that even accounting for jouissance and nietzsche, the most important thing is habit.  [24/08/16 I think what I meant by this was what tim ferris said: life is the sum of small activities done repeatedly] / circumstantial goals

What you can control is what you do at each small interval in time. “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.” - Steve Jobs

Goal Setting is a way to verbalise your intuitions of what you think will make you the happiest at each point. Its probably good to do this just to have a concrete anchor to refer back to for justifying the aversive consequences of your behaviour, like work.

There are three sorts of phenomena that you can control in an attempt to improve the overall quality of your life: your brain chemistry, your thought patterns, and your environment.
- The main determinants of brain chemistrys effects on life quality are: serotonin transporter speed (gxe determined), amount of substrate in system (nutrition determined – complex dietary interactions and amino acids etc), not depleting ones neurotransmitters through excessive stimulation (porn, internet, etc), environmental triggers which cause the production and release of neurotransmitters (and absence of negative ones. See below).
- The main determinants of thought patterns: sensory stimulus in immediate environment (so control your environment – the people you surround yourself with, the activities you spend your time on, and your work and living location), and your explanatory style (seligman).
- The main determinants of your environment are: x

The more that an activity is done repeatedly, the more value it has in determining the quality of your life. This likely encapsulates and explains the measurements of subjective wellbeing and why job satisfaction is the #1 correlate with life satisfaction, because you spend a majority of your life working (and sleeping).

The concept of small wins is also valuable to motivate positive habit formations, as it demonstrates that larger and larger rewards can accrue over time with small but regular behaviours.

So basically there are sets of events which give you pleasure, and sets of events which cause you pain. It is a bit more complex, because some events last longer than others, have more intensity, and have the ability to cause reward by surpassing the pain, or have the ability for diminishing returns, etc.

Humans essentially have a set point for wellbeing that they return to relatively quickly after an event of pain or pleasure, which renders the events only moderately valuable, but still worth pursuing. What is a great endeavour I think is trying to modify the setpoint to a different level. I think this set point is titled hedonic tone in psychology.

Happiness is still more illusory than these previous concepts because of Kahneman's distinction between experienced utility and remembered utility.  ---

# Eliminating Pains
- Flow theory / flow psychology
- "problems"
- https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-23653-008 systematic phenomenology?
- Nietzches idea that pains act as a flagpost to what needs our attention (from school of life)
- Evolution of negative thoughts - negativity bias
  - * Humans (and evo psych) are merely the result of the irrational process of survival and reproduction in genes (will to survive). Pleasure evolved as a reward for the avoidance of pain. How much of a pessimistic or optimistic bias we have when ruminating about the past and future is largely conditioned and a result of thinking habits/patterns which can be changed. Do further research.(read buddhas brain) So “change negative thinking about how the subject feels about themselves, about others and the future” (positive psychology) because belief/disbelief influences the future and the subjects willingness to avoid pain (learned helplessness).
  - * I previously thought the result of evolution was that psych pains always outweighed pleasures regardless of circumstances, but now realise thats not true after seeing blue zones. So the result is that existence is a mistake only for THOSE who arent born wealthy, attractive or raised to be intelligent. The good news is that one can be all these 3 things with enough effort.
  - counterargument: 19.05.18: we tend to remember positive memories longer than negative ones https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658210902791665 from happy money p15 - This is not to say tht all negativity evaporates from our memories.

- 30.12.16 nozick criticism: instead of nozicks pleasure machine. what about pain avoidance machine

## MAXIMISE SENSORY PLEASURES
- Aka Cyrenaicism, Aristippus, positive hedonism
- Imprudent, fleeting. Memories of sensory pleasures and weak and our future may end up bleak with no recourse or help from the past.
- Doesn't account for psychological pains (enduring) such as memories or expectations, psychological desires for girlfriend/compassion/friends/job, boredom etc.

## MAXIMISE PSYCHOLOGICAL PLEASURES
- A circumstantial improvement of ones life would mean curating circumstances which make pleasures (psych and sens) most likely to occur, pains least likely, maximise flow if necessary and minimise inter-flow states of rumination. A sort of self-help/self-sufficiency theory of happiness.
- Some people have good circumstances naturally (rich and attractive) while others have to work hard towards them.

## JOUISSANCE
- We get jouissance obtained in place of the full satisfaction of jouissance expected (relating to psych desires). So attaining our desire is never as great as we expect nor are psych pleasures.
- You don't solve desires to be complete, because you can no longer want it, you only want the fantasy of it. Plus others take their place.  JRE noted this when he said at 40 he realised theres no moment of full happiness or satisfaction you reach – the ride just continues on.
- How to account for this in the previous historical and conceptual analysis?

25/08/16: Although there is some plausability to lacans jouissance theory, it is one of those woopy spoopy philosophical ideas, because the idea of pain and pleasure do clearly still exist as reward and punishment mechanisms. Provide someone with a painful and rewarding experience side by side and see which one they prefer. This simple state of preference is what i am after, not some grand cognitive satisfaction that is illusory.

# MINIMIZING PAINS
## MINIMISE PSYCHOLOGICAL PAINS
- Minimise psychological pains by losing self-reflective consciousness.
- Psychological pains are not only taken at the present, but also past and future – thus more enduring. And more important to people who are more reflective and live inside their mind like myself. Accounts for sadism, memories, expectations, psych desires.
  - Forms: escapism, stoicism, buddhism, alcohol, flow, zapffe, schopenhauer sublimation, terror management theory
  - Therefore, escapism, nietzsche, pleasureseeking arent all opposed but linked in a metamodernist perspective of oscillation, but the problem is ive been sacrificing circumstances at the expense of pleasure/flow.
- Stoicism idea: “psych pain is inevitable, psych suffering is optional”. Then what do we do or desire, bc desire is basically synonymous with pain and if we don't desire then there's no reason to even eat or live. Needs to demarcate its limits. Also, as long as suffering is in your mind, you suffer regardless of opinion, there's no illusion of choice. To say it's optional is to say you can choose not to have those thoughts, which you cannot choose to force out of your head – but you can enter non self reflective consciousness via flow. So stoicism amounts to escapism.
- Flow is focusing attention in a consistent manner. The perk of it is that it is infinitely renewable (like movies, chess, pool, socialising, internet etc) and also easily obtained, as opposed to improving circumstances which require more effort and pain.
- The problem with flow/escapism is that it is also fleeting, there are inter-flow gaps where you realise your poor circumstances and experience psychological pain. And we can't constantly be in flow.


## MINIMISE SENSORY PAINS
- Aka negative hedonism, epicureanism
- Sensory means relates to organs: tacticle (massage/sex/itch), visual (film/art), auditory (music), gustatory (food), olfactory (scent). Not robust enough, see 1.2. Taken only at the present – fleeting.
- This would be sufficient (and we could live completely in the present, but thats not the case) if humans didn't experience psychological pains (enduring) such as memories or expectations, psychological desires for girlfriend/compassion/friends/job, boredom etc.

# MAXIMIZING PAINS
## specifically psychological pains
- Nietzsche thought happiness didn't come from escaping pains but cultivating them because pains are flagposts which draw our attention to what needs to be done (so don't escape them but curate them). Life affirmative philosophy – attempts to embrace consciousness. No pain no gain.
- If improving your circumstances (like working) is painful, that means they are still flagposts to change your behaviour (ie find a more fulfilling job).


 (Nietzsche believed that the greatest pleasures came about as a result of not avoiding pains but using them as guides towards what needs your attention to solve.) [put it under hormesis title. Great idea.]
  - this makes sense when you think about what hungers, thirsts, temperature, tiredness etc motivation ( ... trying to achieve homeostasis by eating, fluid, etc. also see my descriptive motives list.) plays into 'darwinian happiness' book?
  - as chaos pointed out, not every pleasure has a pain that motivates you to seek it (2015) - aesthetic ones like the pleasure of a flower
  - hormesis: 19.11.17: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress seems like a
  - better term than antifragility. | 19.05.18: or hormesis.
  - - https://gettingstronger.org/about-this-blog/ # hormetism
  - - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/negative-emotions-key-well-being/ #

-> you wouldnt want to deliberately maximize negative emotions (at least not the severe ones)
- The lesson is that the bellcurve of emotion is a tricky one and sometimes you might want to expose yourself to pains before you get a peak in pleasure following

But at the end of the day positive emotons are still the desirable emotional state that is being used as the metric of goodness here, we've just acknowledge that negative emotions are sometimes useful.

# Optimize base level / Hedonic Tone
- Hedonic Tone / emotional complexion
  - neurohedonism
- Cig biology etc
- Sleep


“- CONSIDER rewriting my ethical theory in terms of motivation being neuropsychological and life goals as maximising dopamine output // and how the traditional attitudinal/sensory distinction was just mindless intellectual posturing and arbitrary categories.”

I'd like to title this theory neurohedonism, and as it stands, I dont think the word has ever been used.
- I've concluded that all of the theoretical distinction collapses between attitudinal and sensory hedonism are irrelevant to the central dogma of hedonism which modern biology is naturally suggesting but nobody has seemed (as far as I know) to have explicitly stated in hedonistic theory – that pleasure, whether sensory or attitudinal, is good, and it is the **expression of particular neurotransmitter activity.**

- Thus, pleasure is the **expression of particular neurotransmitters and pain is the expression of others.**

- From my current understanding, the pleasure neurotransmitters which should be sought to be maximised are Dopamine, Serotonin, Norepinephrine, opoids, and maybe dynorphin, epinephrine
- From my current understanding, the pain neurotransmitters are Substance P (related to pain signalling, mentally and physically), and glucocticoids (cortisol in humans which is the stress response).
- The normative question then becomes how to maximise some neurotransmitters and reduce others? This is where I think modern science finally usurps philosophy in ethics as it has in all the other fields
- With a proposition such as “the more of certain transmitters, the better/more good/higher the value of the experience” one can easily see how quantifiable/falsifiable replies to objections of locke and bentham can be produced.
- I feel as if this could be extremely influential in political policies
- Another reformulation would be “the more of particular neurotransmitters the life contains, the better the life”
- So for objections like at the end of Feldman “the repugnant response” or whatever that a life containing a lot of small pleasures and nothing else is adverise, perhaps its because its speaking in abstract language like the rest of hedonistic theory has and missed that perhaps having small static levels of particular positive neurotransmitters like dopamine doesnt offset dysthemia or small persistent static levels of negative ones which produce boredom or pain

# neurohedonism
maximise adrenaline, oxytocin and dopamine
-- exercise, socially bond, and take wellbutrin?
-- quit movies and computer (lowers dopamine, seeking system)
-- quit porn (lowers dopamine, seeking system)
-- hug people daily

minimise cortisol
-- by doing above,

cosmetic pharmacology
> see /health/drugs/depressants/pristiq too for info on cosmetic pharmacology

* There is a handful of Neurotransmitters which are implicated in well-being:
- Only Dopamine, Serotonin, and Norepinephrine out of the ~100 neurotransmitters seem to be implicated in depression. Epinephrine is also implicated in wakefulness. And Glucocorticoids in modulating the stress response.
* The value/happiness of one's life is determined by the balance of the relevant neurotransmitters.
* Keep in mind the human brain is plastic and is changing every second. Fire together wire together.


* The main factors that contribute to the balance of the relevant neurotransmitters are:
– Whether or not you have the **depression gene** ((1) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12161658 (Technically, The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the promotor region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), not the gene itself. (1b) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12869766  – This paper showed that individuals who carried a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) were more vulnerable to developing depression following exposure to stressful life events.. (1c) http://brainworldmagazine.com/the-new-new-genetics-gets-practical/) Stressful life events were measured as employment, financial, housing, health, and relationship stressors.), in conjunction with **stressful early life** events which increases likelihood of depression (Gene x Environment interaction). This explains why stressful events lead to depression in some people but not in others.

- Massages increase dopamine and serotonin, and decrease cortisol (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162447)
– Coffee increases Serotonin transmission, but you build up a tolerance and may have withdrawals without it.
- Take fish oil daily, as deficiency in omega 3 can result in mood disorders (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16741195)
- The ability to delay gratification is the #1 predictor of future success (?). Interestingly, the ability to delay gratification is mediated by serotonin levels (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18434531).
- Taking antidepressant drugs (SSRI, SNDRI etc.) to off-set the negative brain chemistry consequences (depression) of stressful early life events
- Not depleting one's reward system through excessive porn or masturbation (http://www.yourbrainonporn.com/adolescent-brain-meets-highspeed-internet-porn)
- Engaging in regular exercise (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise#Depression)
