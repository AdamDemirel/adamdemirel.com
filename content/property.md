This article is in the vein of a handful of others which fall under the category of "property recommendations". Or rather "rational attempts at spending money to improve your happiness". The most popular of which was Rob's, circulating and gaining popularity throughout 2019. Here's a list of others which this is inspired by:

This is my attempt at making a list of recommendations. These are based on having read through a list of popular threads on LessWrong, and categorizing the main types of recommendations which popped up. Those threads being:

- [How can I spend money to improve my life?](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wnnsqR784yx7KNtmk/how-can-i-spend-money-to-improve-my-life)
- [Low Hanging fruit for buying a better life](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CYDSRKEJruoKgdBXa/low-hanging-fruit-for-buying-a-better-life)

# Things Others Recommend

The main categories of recommendations that I teased out in the posts above were the following:

**Spend Money/Time Optimizing Boring Things You Use a Lot**
- eg: bed, bedsheets, shoes, computer chair, hygiene products, clothes

**Fix annoying life bugs / Remove minor inconeniences that bother you everyday**
- eg: laser eye surgery

**Spend money on workstation ergonomics**
  - eg: standing desk, good mouse, tenkeyless mechanical keyboard, good chair, big monitor

**Spend money to improve your health**
  - eg: DNA test, water filter, grocery/eating "systems", electric toothbrush, stannous fluoride toothpaste, bicycle

**Spend money on socialising / Spend Money That Lets You Spend Time With Others**
  - eg: drinking alcohol, join a social sport, improv class, table tennis club, rock climbing, donate to a charity

**Spend money on efficiency / Speed up things that take time**
  - eg: productivity tools (eg notion / workflowy), nootropics, contactless charging, kindle, smart lights, waterpik, audiobooks

**Spend money on having fun / Improving your happiness**
  - eg: therapy, sex toys, quality food, attending classes, join a martial art, meditation classes, video games, picking up skills (eg raspberry pi), massages, theatre setup, world travel

# Things I Recommend

I've experimented with a lot of the above, and others. Of the things I've tried, here's a list of the things that I think have had a big payoff (either in impact, or repeatability of effects):

- Laser Eye Surgery, if you are eligible and have bad eyes (cost: ~3.5k AUD)
- Quality Mattress. You're either laying in bed, or in shoes. [You'll spend 1/3rd of your life on it](/sleep).
- Following above - quality shoes you like wearing.
- A genetic test or seeing a specialist, and figure out if your mental health can benefit from any specific nutrients. In my case, discovering I have the MTRR gene and supplementing B vitamins works quite well.
- Investing in Index Funds. Insert all the usual stuff about 5k now being worth 50k in 20 years.
- A [bicycle](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/18/get-rich-with-bikes/)
- If you don't work remotely, having a commute shorter than 20 minutes to your workplace [has a huge effect on your happiness](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YSWa8rYeD3aDaofSP/rational-home-buying).
- Practicing a social hobby (jiujitsu) has been huge for me. Spending money on meeting people / socialising more is [probably the best ways to spend money](/happiness).
- Travelling has a high ROI
- Spend leftover money on good food, massages, and novel experiences

### Other general advice I think is worth nothing:
- Start with a goal (eg be happy, or live long) rather than how to get rid of all your money.
- “desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want”
- Whenever you want to buy something, wait a few weeks to let the impulse subside to see if you still want it
- [https://dcurt.is/the-best](https://dcurt.is/the-best)
- Get rid of stuff - it costs to maintain
