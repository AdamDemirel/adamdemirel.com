# Maximising pleasure
So we've seen that two potential methods for increasing our happiness sum is by minimising pleasure (which fails), and maximising pain (which can indirectly work in particular ways). But the most obvious method we can use and the one which most of us focus all of our efforts on is maximising pleasures / positive experiences.

We've acknowledged that there's a handful of methods we can use to improve our positive experiences:
- Repeat small pleasurable events often
- Focus on large impactful events

But I'm going to add two more:
- Shape our global judgements about our life
- Savoring / Prolonging individual experiences

I'm going to focus on repeatability and savoring first due to their brevity.

### Situation Selection
We have already noted how behavioral habits can be important because they can act as looping experiences which compound. Another thing you could do is modify your **environmental triggers** so you aren't exposed to triggers of bad emotional states, and are exposed to good ones. For example, if you found that going on certain apps or websites made you unhappy, it would be wise to stop doing so. In fact, some cool research suggests that **[situation selection](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/20/preliminary-evidence-that-situation-selection-can-help-us-regulate-our-emotions/)** - doing activities and being places that make you feel good, and avoiding people who make you feel bad, is an effective intervention for reducing negative emotions. But we can also use it to increase the positive.

## Repeatable Pleasures
So the first method we can use to increase happiness is to increase as many of these pleasures as possible. That can either be by maximising the sensory pleasures as per the Cyrenaics, or we can increase as many psychological pleasures as possible - by socialising, learning, loving, being in nature, and engaging in novel activities.

## Savoring
The second method that we can use to increase happiness is to prolong individual experiences, that is, take them from an experience smaller in intensity and time and make them more intense and longer is a technique called [savoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoring).

![savoring](/images/happiness/savoring.jpg)

Savoring can be achieved by:
* Being mindful/present/attentive to your current positive experiences
* Anticipating your positive experiences in advance
* Reminscing on positive memories
* Avoiding dampening / "killjoy" thinking about positive experiences, and
* Communicating your positive experiences to others with positive facial expressions. The effect can be bolstered by sharing your positive emotions with others while you have them.

It's also shown that not only does savoring improve positive experiences directly, but also has a bunch of other positive effects: helps build stronger relationships with others, improves mental and physical health, reduce hopelessness, and increases creative problem solving.

Some researchers believe that savoring can be state based (ie about a particular experience) or trait based - a disposition for all experiences. What this suggests is that cultivating trait savoring can have large effects long term. Interestingly, there is also an opposing phenomena to savoring called dampening where you reduce the intensity and duration of positive emotions, which some believed is a personality trait. Research also supports that one of the reasons wealthier people are less happy is due to lower savoring ability ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20483819)). People with lower self esteem also savor less and are more likely to dampen. And Easterners tend to savor less than westerners ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21910543)).

## Big Events
The third method we can use to increase happiness is to focus on big life events. This is an appealing approach because increasing a lot of small pleasures in life doesn't intuitively feel too impactful, and thus most of us are actually drawn away from that in the hopes of attaining some large big pleasure later, as Nietzsche suggested.

![a](/images/happiness/bigpleasure.jpg)

So how do we figure out which pleasure events have the largest effect? One way is that we could observe others/look at happiness narratives, but obviously this would be crude. If we looked over the list and used our intuition - we would probably guess that travelling, gaining wealth, gaining a romantic partner, and accomplishment would have disproportionate effects. I find the idea of success being defined as *the best in world* to be interesting for this reason. Even for something trivial like a video game (as previewed in the great documentary [The King of Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Kong)), you would expect this would cause a great amount of joy /a large sum of psychological pleasure.

Unfortunately there is not any perfect research measuring the curve or experience of all the different pleasures we laid out, but there is some self-report data on how unemployment, marriage, divorse, widowhood, childbirth, and layoff affect happiness [here](https://appen.com/blog/promoting-diversity-and-inclusion-in-the-workplace-appen-hires-over-50-persons-with-disabilities-pwds-lifeatappen/).

![a](/images/happiness/lifeevents.png)

What is shows is that people tend to get a substantial drop in happiness after employment, approaching widowhood, marriage, and after the birth of a child, and a substantial boost in happiness after divorce and layoff.

Other research suggests big positive changes for: starting a new relationship (highest) and gaining employment, starting pregnancy, starting a new educational course, and buying a new house ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17905809)). The events that had the highest negative impacts were ending of relationships, and death of a parent. And other papers echo that the large events are related to marriage, divorce, bereavement, deaths, work, ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289759/)).



### Diminishing Returns
What the chart above demonstrated was the odd fact that a lot of us have heard of, that whether it is a large positive event (such as winning the lottery), or large negative event (like an injury), our reports about our happiness tend to return to a relatively stable baseline after ~5years. People tend to adapt to common large life events by returning to a baseline. But that doesn't discount their effects on our total happiness while they are occurring.

![diminishing returns](/images/happiness/diminishing.jpg)

This is one of the sad facts about human experience and pleasure. The first bite of a meal is great, the last is not great. Or in more general terms, the more we do of something pleasurable, the less enjoyable it becomes. Most of us have experienced this personally in the form of dreaming for something: a product or experience, and once attaining it moving on with life. In this form of diminishing returns, it is what Economists call [Diminishing Marginal Utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Diminishing_marginal_utility).

This makes sense evolutionary as remember that pleasures are rewards for attaining a need, and obviously we cannot be in a constant state of bliss because (a) the need gets satisfied quickly, and (b) if we were constantly experiencing pleasure we wouldn't seek out our needs. This is one of the big critiques of most utopian societies (as [Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer) wrote about).

This returning to baseline after experiencing pleasure (or pain), whether big or small, is what's known as the [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) where like a treadmill you're gaining pleasure but keep returning to the same level of happiness. Obviously this doesn't make pleasures completely pointless to chase, as we mentioned you're still experiencing an increase in happiness before returning to the baseline.

Other research calls this return to baseline the Hedonic Adaptation Prevention Model, which leads us into looking at any ways that it can be prevented. The psychologist [Sonja Lyubomirsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonja_Lyubomirsky) is the leading researcher in this area and covered a lot of it in her book [The How of Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2326098.The_How_of_Happiness). One of the main ideas is that we can prevent adapting to positive experiences by (1) continuing to savor them, and (2) having continuied variety of experiences ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22361725)). Novelty is one of the pleasure events that we mentioned in our list, and it turns out one of the reasons it is so great is that it is the solution to adaptation.

A third solution can be found in the great book with a bad name [Happy Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15803098-happy-money), which is simply to partake in the pleasurable experiences less frequently - this is another mode for preventing adaptation.

### Impact Bias
Another sad fact of reality and related bias is the tendency for humans to overestimate the intensity and duration of pleasures (fortunately and pains), what's caleed the [impact bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_bias). This is related to the psychoanalyst Lacan's concept of [Jouissance](https://www.lacan.com/forced.htm) - wher we get a milder "jouissance obtained" in place of the full satisfaction of a "jouissance expected" - so attaining pleasures or fulfilling our desire is never as great as we expect.

On a more macro scale, this reminds me of when you read stories of traditionally successful figures and they often remark at ages 40-50 that they realised that there's no moment of "complete happiness/satisfaction" that you reach, like they expected before they were successful, the ride just continues on. This is both terrifying and enlightening - it doesn't really matter what big events we do or don't get, and the smaller events are within our control. Also, again it doesn't matter if we return to baseline, the pains/pleasure preceding that drop to baseline are still valid experiences, regardless of experiencing some *grand cognitive satisfaction*.


## Subjective Wellbeing
As mentioned, one of the four methods to maximise our happiness is to "shape our global judgements about life". What I was referring to their were self-reports of happiness/[wellbeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being_contributing_factors)].

And just as you would expect, psychologists have tried [operationalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operationalization) happiness - making it as measurable as possible. This is useful for any construct because it means we can standardise it and try to find practical applications for the research. The way they have done this is simply by *asking* people how happy they are.

Psychologists have done just this. Measuring happiness in the Psychology literature has often gone by the title '**[Subjective Wellbeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_well-being)** (SWB)', rather than 'happiness'. The reason is because the word happiness is a single construct, whereas subjective wellbeing captures two constructs - cognitive and emotional as shown below. The field began in 1984 and was developed by [Ed Diener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Diener) which has done a lot of work in the area.

There are two primary ways of measuring happiness by this model:
1. **The Cognitive Account** of happiness relies on a measurement called **[Life Satisfaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_satisfaction) Reports** which is a 1-5 question self-report survey, with the question almost always verbatim *"all things considered, how happy are you with your life at the moment on a scale of 1–10?"*
2. **The Affective / Emotional account** - this measure of 'affective balance' is also self-reported but rather than trying to capture one's happiness in a single retrospective measurement, tries to capture the presence of positive emotions and negative emotions over time. Conducted either via the '**Day Reconstruction Method**' where the participant fills out a diary of the previous days activities and moods, or the **Experience Sampling Method** where participants are mesaged at nrandom itnervals of the day to record their activities and mood.

The validity and drawbacks of both of these will discussed later. First let's get out of the way what the research on Life Satisfaction reports has found.

How they are important to us is that if we believe that life satisfaction reports are accurate, for instance, one way that we could try to maximise positive emotions is to do the things that make people rate the highest and eliminate the ones that people rate the lowest. This was the benefit of the scientific method that we mentioned at the start - by using large datasets and the scientific method, we can discover the behaviors, beliefs, environments, or variables that lead to happiness.

Thanks in part to the [Positive Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology) movement, recent years have brought a surge of interest in the correlates of subjective well-being. *Self Reporting* is a technical way of saying 'the measurement of asking people'. It is purported to measure subjective well-being, which is the technical name for self-reported happiness.

If you ask people how happy they are on a scale of 1–10, they can self-report a 7 for instance, and this can give a somewhat accurate picture of the state of affairs if you assume that people know how they feel (have the self awareness) and have the ability to attach a number to it. There's no reason to think that we can't do this since we can do a thing called *intensity matching*. Intensity matching is converting between different unrelated mediums. For example, if I ask you "If John 6'2 and Peter is 5'2, and John is as angry as he is tall, how angry is Peter?", you're likely to answer "less angry than John" or something of the sort. It turns out that humans can and do utilise this for all sorts of thinking. People can do a similar thing with happiness.

This has largely been the method of scientists over the last 50 years with life satisfaction research. This has been the fruit of the new science of happiness starting in the 90s (ie positive psychology). What happens is that you ask enough people this question and correlate it with other questions such as how much money they make, whether they are happy with their relationships, how much they sleep, etc. You then find items that correlate highly with people saying they are satisfied with their life and you assume there is some link between the two when there are enough people, via statistical analysis. The factor may not cause happiness, but some sort of association is usually enough to suggest that there is a real relationship we are measuring. If we find out that two things correlate highly, then we can do randomised studies where we compare the two groups and find out whether the thing causes the happiness or whether happiness causes the thing. eg do people who smoke become unhappier or do unhappier people smoke?
