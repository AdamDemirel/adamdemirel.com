# Maximizing pleasure
So we've seen that there are two potential methods for increasing our happiness total. The first was by minimizing pain, which fails. The second was by strategically maximizing pain in the short term, which can result in net happiness in the long term, but this isn't too effective. The two most obviously impactful methods are by directly maximizing pleasure and by minimizing pain. These are the two that most of us already focus all of our efforts on. We will come back to minimizing pains in a later section, but for now, let's look at how we can improve our happiness by maximizing positive states.

So we've already noted that there's a few theoretical methods that we can use to maximize pleasures:
* Repeat small pleasures often
* Focus on large pleasure events (like Nietzsche hinted at)
* But a third potential way is by savoring or prolonging episodes of pleasure.

These are three theoretical methods that apply to all pleasure episodes which I'll cover here first.

After that is where we get into the real meat of the modern research on happiness. We will be looking at the science of what makes people happy in the section on **Subjective Wellbeing**.

## Repeatable Pleasures
> Humans don´t live in territories but in habits. — Peter Sloterdijk

So the first theoretical method that we can use to increase pleasures is to increase the frequency of them - as per the Cyrenaics did for physical pleasures. They consumed as many of them as possible. We can also do that for the mental pleasures - by socializing, learning, loving, engaging in novel activities, being in nature, or whatever else is on our pleasure episodes list.

Repeatability is interesting because doing a small thing enough times can compound to have large effects. So even if there are a few events which result in the largest pleasure gains and pain removals, perhaps there are activities that we can do repeatedly which can improve our lives in small ways which add up to a large total over time. This is a smart view to take when you consider that **our lives are a sum of the small activities that we do repeatedly** - whether that be sleep, eat, socialize, work, play, our thoughts, the environment we are in, or our daily habits. They are recurring emotional experiences which compose the majority of our lives.

What this additional criteria suggests is that one way to improve your happiness is to find ways in which you can make repeatable small gains in pleasure and the removal of pain, which add up over time. I think why a lot of lay happiness theories get this premise wrong is because humans have a tendency to think globally in the timespan of a whole life and spotlight large events, rather think linearly and acknowledge that life is a secession of discrete events. This reminds me of an interesting point brought up in the movie [Before Sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Sunset) where the main actor mentions how crazy it is that we are **living** our life right now.

## Large Pleasure Episodes
The second theoretical method that we can use to increase our total pleasures is by focusing on episodes of experience which include large quantities of pleasure - in intensity and duration. This is what most people spend their life chasing - those few big payoffs: whether that be having kids, buying a house, getting tenure, winning the lottery, becoming the world best, travelling, acquiring prestige, acquiring freedom, being famous, finding The One and getting married, or finding their dream job.

This is an appealing approach because increasing a lot of small pleasures in life doesn't intuitively feel too impactful, and thus most of us are actually drawn away from that in the hopes of attaining some large pleasure episodes later.

And I'm not denying that these large pleasure episodes actually are larger than the smaller pleasures. The research supports that, and when I watch something trivial like the documentary [The King of Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Kong)) and see the joy on being the best at something trivial like a video game, it supports that conclusion.

I will come back to this more in the section on Subjective Wellbeing because before we can attempt to answer the theoretical question of which episodes actually result in the largest pleasures, first we need a method of measurement to answer it, which will we cover there.

## Savoring
The third theoretical method that we can use to increase pleasures is to increase the duration of them. One way to do that is just to partake in pleasures which are naturally long, as the previous setion hinted. Another way is to intentionally increase the duration of pleasures we are naturally already exposed to. This technique is called [savoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoring) in psychology, and it is where an experience smaller in intensity and time is taken and intentionally made longer and more intense.

![savoring](/images/happiness/savoring.jpg)

The research shows that it can be achieved by:
* Being mindful/present/attentive to your current positive experiences
* Anticipating the positive experiences in advance
* Reminiscing on positive memories
* Avoiding dampening / "killjoy" thinking about positive experiences, and
* Sharing your positive emotions with others while you have them.

It's also shown that not only does savoring improve positive experiences directly, but also has a bunch of other positive effects: helps build stronger relationships with others, improves mental and physical health, reduce hopelessness, and increases creative problem solving.

Some researchers believe that savoring can be state based (ie about a particular experience) or trait based - a disposition for all experiences. What this suggests is that cultivating trait savoring can have large effects long term. Interestingly, there is also an opposing phenomena to savoring called dampening where you reduce the intensity and duration of positive emotions, which some believed is a personality trait. Research also supports that one of the reasons wealthier people are less happy is due to lower savoring ability ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20483819)). People with lower self esteem also savor less and are more likely to dampen. And Easterners tend to savor less than westerners ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21910543)).

## Subjective Wellbeing
Alright so let's get into it. Thanked in part to the [Positive Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology) movement, recent years have brought a surge of interest in the correlates of happiness.

As you would expect, Psychologists have tried [operationalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operationalization) happiness and [wellbeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being_contributing_factors)] by making it as measurable as possible. This is useful for any construct because it means we can standardize it and try to find practical applications for the research.

The way they have done this is simply by *asking* people how happy they are, and getting them to *subjectively* tell you - since their happiness is a subjective experience. *Self Reporting* is a technical way of saying 'the measurement of asking people'. Hence the title of this area of research - **[Subjective Wellbeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_well-being)** (SWB).

If you ask people how happy they are on a scale of 1–10, they can self-report a 7 for instance, and this can give a somewhat accurate picture of the state of affairs if you assume that people know how they feel (have the self awareness) and have the ability to attach a number to it. There's no reason to think that we can't do this since we can do a thing called *intensity matching*. Intensity matching is converting between different unrelated mediums. For example, if I ask you "If John 6'2 and Peter is 5'2, and John is as angry as he is tall, how angry is Peter?", you're likely to answer "less angry than John" or something of the sort. It turns out that humans can and do utilize this for all sorts of thinking. People can do a similar thing with happiness.

The field began in 1984 and was developed by [Ed Diener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Diener) which has done a lot of pioneering work in the area. He mentions that the word happiness tries to capture a single construct, whereas subjective wellbeing captures two - the cognitive and emotional account as shown below. It also emphasizes the subjective nature of happiness measurements - as opposed to the objective nature of measurement in Economics that occurred prior to that, under the term 'decision utility'.

Classical Economists would infer user preferences based on the decisions that they made, based on the assumption that consumers were rational and tried to maximize their utility (ie happiness) at all times ([ref](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951240?seq=1)). They could then make inferences about their happiness based on their decisions. Unfortunately this turned out to be wrong and consumers often exhibit a lot of [biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality) in their decisions which show that they are not rational in maximizing their happiness at all.

Therefore the solution was to stop inferring their preferences from their behavior, and to ask them directly what made them happy.

So you can see that the crux of the issue is that humans experience a wavering of pleasures and pains over time, captured in a single episode. What we want to be able to do is accurately measure this - this is the real crux of all happiness research. Previously economists would infer these pleasure and pain utilities based on their behavior, which turns out to be inaccurate.

The two methods that Psychologists developed to measure the pleasure/pain over an episode, is ([ref](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951240?seq=1)):
1. **Remembered Utility**.
2. **Experienced Utility**.

Remembered Utility is the cognitive account. It has been the primary method of measuring happiness in the SWB literature and has used by the majority of the studies. In these studies, subjects are asked to self-report their level of happiness on a scale such as [1-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale), in an attempt to capture their amount of utilities over that episode. The measurement can be about a specific area of one's life, such as work or home, in what's called *domain satisfaction* reports. Or it can be a global judgement/evaluation about one's whole life - which has been the primary measure of happiness, in what's called **[Life Satisfaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_satisfaction) Reports**. Life Satisfaction reports are usually a 1-5 question survey with the questions almost always verbatim *"all things considered, how happy are you with your life at the moment on a scale of 1–10?"*. In answering these, they are making a cognitive retrospective evaluation of the episode after it has finished, whether that be a week later, years later, or a global evaluation about their whole life like in the life satisfaction reports.

Experienced Utility is the emotional account. It is a more recently developed form of measurement popularized by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (the creator of Flow psychology) and Daniel Kahneman. It is also referred to as 'Affective Balance' in the psychology research (Affect referring to positive and negative emotions). It also depends on self-report, just like Remembered Utility research, but rather than being measured after the episode is finished, and capture one's level of net pleasure/pains in a single report, it tries to capture many self-reports *during* the episodes. It does so by what's called the **Experience Sampling Method** where participants are messaged or paged at random intervals of the day to record their activities, who they are with, and their mood.

Experienced Utility has an added benefit in accuracy over Remembered Utility as you would expect. But first lets look at what the abundant research on Life Satisfaction has revealed, before we look at the drawbacks over this form of measurement.

Before we dig into that, the way this fits into our model is that if we can accurately measure what makes people happy - or what causes pleasures/pains over an episode, in a study of a [large sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) of people, firstly it can overcome biases and blind spots that we as individuals may have in measuring our own individual happiness. But secondly, even though we have a table of pleasure and pain episodes, we don't know the hierarchy of importance. So this gives us a method we longed for in answering Nietzsche's question of figuring out which pleasure episodes are the most important.

Unfortunately the research has not dug into all of the pleasure episodes we have laid out in our table, but it has covered a large surface area of what it considered to be the most important.
