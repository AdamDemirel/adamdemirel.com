# MINIMIZING PAINS
- minimising pain - see my pains list
  - minimising desires
  - minimising desire / downshifting


individuals actually display a positivity bias (ref https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41562-018-0307-6) rather than negativity bias

## MINIMISE PSYCHOLOGICAL PAINS
- Minimise psychological pains by losing self-reflective consciousness.
- Psychological pains are not only taken at the present, but also past and future – thus more enduring. And more important to people who are more reflective and live inside their mind like myself. Accounts for sadism, memories, expectations, psych desires.
  - Forms: escapism, stoicism, buddhism, alcohol, flow, zapffe, schopenhauer sublimation, terror management theory
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being_contributing_factors#Personal_factors see terror management theory
  - Therefore, escapism, nietzsche, pleasureseeking arent all opposed but linked in a metamodernist perspective of oscillation, but the problem is ive been sacrificing circumstances at the expense of pleasure/flow.
- Stoicism idea: “psych pain is inevitable, psych suffering is optional”. Then what do we do or desire, bc desire is basically synonymous with pain and if we don't desire then there's no reason to even eat or live. Needs to demarcate its limits. Also, as long as suffering is in your mind, you suffer regardless of opinion, there's no illusion of choice. To say it's optional is to say you can choose not to have those thoughts, which you cannot choose to force out of your head – but you can enter non self reflective consciousness via flow. So stoicism amounts to escapism.
- Flow is focusing attention in a consistent manner. The perk of it is that it is infinitely renewable (like movies, chess, pool, socialising, internet etc) and also easily obtained, as opposed to improving circumstances which require more effort and pain.
- The problem with flow/escapism is that it is also fleeting, there are inter-flow gaps where you realise your poor circumstances and experience psychological pain. And we can't constantly be in flow.


[This](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/negative-emotions-key-well-being/) interesting article points out various interesting research on how attempts to suppress negative thoughts actually make them more present, and so the key is to accept them. This is interesting but this does not support the idea that we should endure negative thoughts, they are still intriscally bad, what it acknowledges is perhaps a better way to mitigate their affect is indirect - by accepting them.


## MINIMISE SENSORY PAINS
- Aka negative hedonism, epicureanism
- Sensory means relates to organs: tacticle (massage/sex/itch), visual (film/art), auditory (music), gustatory (food), olfactory (scent). Not robust enough, see 1.2. Taken only at the present – fleeting.
- This would be sufficient (and we could live completely in the present, but thats not the case) if humans didn't experience psychological pains (enduring) such as memories or expectations, psychological desires for girlfriend/compassion/friends/job, boredom etc.




# Eliminating Pains
- Flow theory / flow psychology
- "problems"
- https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-23653-008 systematic phenomenology?
- Nietzches idea that pains act as a flagpost to what needs our attention (from school of life)
- Evolution of negative thoughts - negativity bias
  - * Humans (and evo psych) are merely the result of the irrational process of survival and reproduction in genes (will to survive). Pleasure evolved as a reward for the avoidance of pain. How much of a pessimistic or optimistic bias we have when ruminating about the past and future is largely conditioned and a result of thinking habits/patterns which can be changed. Do further research.(read buddhas brain) So “change negative thinking about how the subject feels about themselves, about others and the future” (positive psychology) because belief/disbelief influences the future and the subjects willingness to avoid pain (learned helplessness).
  - * I previously thought the result of evolution was that psych pains always outweighed pleasures regardless of circumstances, but now realise thats not true after seeing blue zones. So the result is that existence is a mistake only for THOSE who arent born wealthy, attractive or raised to be intelligent. The good news is that one can be all these 3 things with enough effort.
  - counterargument: 19.05.18: we tend to remember positive memories longer than negative ones https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658210902791665 from happy money p15 - This is not to say tht all negativity evaporates from our memories. Particularly negative experiences can sometimes become manigified in memories review mirror.
