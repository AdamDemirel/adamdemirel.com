# Minimising Pleasures
Beyond the reasons given by the greeks about how seeking physical pleasures that weren't necessary for survival may lead to physical pain, which we discounted, there isn't really any strong reason to minimise pleasures, or schools of thought that advocate doing so. This is obviously going to be the least developed section of our 4 as it's difficult to imagine how a happy life could be arrived at by deliberately minimising pleasures as much as possible.
