# Minimizing Pleasures
This section is here for theoretical completeness.

But beyond the reasons given by the Greeks about how seeking physical pleasures not necessary for survival may lead to physical pain, which we discounted, there isn't really any strong reason to minimize pleasures, or schools of thought that advocate doing so. This is obviously going to be the least developed section of our 4 as it's difficult to imagine how a happy life could be arrived at by deliberately minimizing pleasures as much as possible.
