call it net affect insteas as per kahneman

### Affective Balance
The experience of a moment or an episode is not easily represented by a single happiness value.  as we saw above. But there is another and potentially more accurate way to measure emotions over time, and researchers have attempted to do just that by measuring what they call 'positive affect' and 'negative affect' - equivalent to positive and negative emotions.

And they try to measure affect in a way that allows us to see how people feel about their lives **moment to moment**, rather than retrospectively. This is obviously a *much* superior method because rather than relying on a single report, we can take many reports throughout the day, where the participant is extremely closer in time and space to the events being measured, and see how people feel about it.

It still depends on self-reports similar to life satisfaction, so will still have a few flaws eg dishonest reports. But the much bigger benefit of the reports are that they measure: "**right now, not later; and right there; not elsewhere**.

Daniel Kahneman did a lot of the work in this area after discovering the flaws of life satisfaction reports in the paper X. In chapter 37 "Experiencinged Well-Being" of his popular book Thinking Fast and Slow, he referred to life satisfaction reports as **remembered utility** (utility being a measurement of happiness), and these moment to moment reports as **experienced utility**. Due to it being able to measure experiences as they are being had, or shortly after, it is granted to give a more accurate judgement of experience. More clearly: If I were to ask you how currently feeling rather than how you felt a week ago, you'd give me a more accurate answer. That's what this research aims to get at.

This gives some interesting results - as what you would expect is that how people feel moment to moment would be the same as how people remember feeling, but this is not the case. I will give an extreme example of that at the end of this article, but for now, I'm going to cover the relevant findings from using this methodology.

To measure experienced utility over one's whole  life, a continuous recording of experience is unfortunately impossible - a person cannot live normally while constantly reporting their experiences. But it can be done in controlled psychology experiments, and has been done ([ref](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/media/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Kahneman_2006_Measurement.pdf)). The method used is giving the subject a lever which moves markers on a scale from very pleasant to very unpleasant, which they move in real time during an experience - such as being exposed  to loud noises or watching a speech. These studies result in an ideal form of happiness measurement: a moment to moment measurements of a subjects emotional state.

Research shows that people provide similar profiles to painful experiences over time - eg participants ratings of pain while dipping their hands in water that changed in temperature overtime ([ref](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/media/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Kahneman_2006_Measurement.pdf)), Participants end up averaging their ratings at roughly the same number.

But when asking those same subjects to sum up or evaluate their experience as a whole, of their remembered utility, participants reveal systematic biases. Although they do seem to be able to classify past experiences generally as pleasant or painful. The biggest bias was **duration neglect** in which the duration of the pain or pleasure was completely neglected in weighting the moments. What did seem to influence the retrospective evaluation was the peak of the experience, and the end - what's come to be known as the [peak-end rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule). Funnily enough this remembered experience is also the one that influences peoples decisions, rather than the experience sum.

So what we now know is that pain and pleasure **can** be measured in real time, and that life satisfaction reports are not a good measure of the sum total of the actual experience.

The closest alternative is the **Experience Sampling Method**, which Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (the dude that also created the theory of *flow states*) invented. What he did was give people a bunch of diaries or pagers and then pinged them at random times during the day (or more recently vibrated peoples phones). When he pinged them, they would report what they were currently doing when they were interrupted, who they were with, and how they felt (using a rating scale of various feelings - happiness, tension, anger, worry, pain, engagement, and more). Using this ingenious method we could get a direct measure of how people were *currently* feeling whilst doing various activities. With large enough datasets which can begin to find correlations which give support to the conclusion that certain activities are associated with pleasurable and painful states.

"Stone, Arthur and Saul Shiffman. 1994. “Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) in Behavioral Medicine.” Annals of Behavioral Medicine. 16,
pp. 199–202."

You can see how this is similar to the remembered utility measurements but it is far more accurate as you are no longer depending on the quality of the subject's memory to accurately report their experience and it overcomes most of the issues bound up in framing effects.

Applications of the Experience Sampling Method have unfortunately been limited due to it being difficult to implement in large sample sizes. An alternative that also relies on being close to the experience is the Day Reconstruction Method. It is similar to ESM in its use of diaries to recall activities and emotions, but they are asked to fill it out once about the prior day. They write down when events began and ended, what they were doing, where they where, who they were with and how they felt.

An early version of the DRM ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15576620)) found that despite relying on a day old memory, the DRM reproduces results of the ESM accurately. And it semems to be an efficient approxmimatin in replacement -place- of the more ESM.

The following data shows what experiences are correlated with positive and negative emotions. The Net Affect column is the average of positive emotions minus the average of negative emotions. The last column is the **U-index** - a misery index of sorts, which measures the proportion of time that people spend in an unpleasant state. It is a proportion of time (aggregated over respondents) in which the highest rated feeling was a negative feeling. In other words the higher the U-index number, the more that people report feeling unhappy whilst doing the activity. For the morning commute, individuals spent on average 28% of the time in an unpleasant state, whereas only 4% for sex. The biggest surprise was the emotional experience of the time spent with one's children, which for American women was slightly less enjoyable than doing housework.

![uindex](/images/happiness/uindex.png)

>Overall, the results in Table 2 indicate that net affect is highest, on average, when individuals are engaged in leisure activities (such as socializing after work) and lowest when they are engaged in market work and investment or personal maintenance activities (such as housecleaning). Commuting in the morning appears particularly unpleasant. Social contact during an episode is associated with high positive emotions,. Interestingly, in our data the average net affect experienced during episodes of commuting rises to that of the overall average level if the commuter is accompanied by someone, indicating the influence of social contact.

> A striking observation was the extent of inequality in the distribution of emotional pain. About half our participants reported going through an entire day without experiencing an unpleasant episode. On the other hand, a significant minority of the population experienced considerable emotional distress for much of the day. It appears that a small fraction of the population does most of the suffering - whether because of physical or mental illness, an unhappy temperament, or the misfortunes and personal tragedies in their life.

Not surprisingly, a headache will make a person miserable, and the second best predictor of the feelings of a day is whether a person did or did not have contacts with friends or relatives. **It is only a slight exaggeration to say that happiness is the experience of spending time with people you love and who love you.**

Some other findings are:

![experiencingself](/images/happiness/experiencing.png)

What should be noted is that although the findings are important for highlighting which activities are associated with positive and negative affect - there is a balance to be shared as there is diminishing returns for pursuing one activity ([ref](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/media/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Kahneman_2006_Measurement.pdf))

While net affect and reported life satisfaction are positively correlated, differences between them are worth emphasizing. Personality variables - including factors such as sleep, depression, and religiosity - predict life satisfaction and net affect about equally well. Demographic factors, including ethnicity, income, education, and marital status, predict life satisfaction more strongly than they predict affect. Time use predicts net affect more than it predicts life satisfaction. These contrasts suggest that net affect provides a window on people's experience that is distinct from that captured by standard life satisfaction measures.

Some aspects of life have more effect on the evaluation of one's life than on the experience of living. Educational attainment is an example. More education is associated with a higher evaluation of one's life, but not with greater experienced well-being. On the other hand, ill health has a much stronger adverse effect on experienced well-being than on life evaluation. Living with children also imposes a significant cost in the currency of daily feelings - reports of stress and anger are common among parents, but the adverse effects on life evaluation are smaller.

* An analysis of more than 450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily survey of 1,000 Americans, provides a surprisingly definite answer to the most frequently asked question in well-being research: **Can money buy happiness?** The conclusion is that being poor makes one miserable and that being rich may enhance one's life satisfaction, but does not (on average) improve experienced well-being.
* The beneficial effects of the weekend on experienced well-being are significantly smaller for the very poor than for most everyone else.
* The satiation level beyond which experienced well-being no longer increases was a household income of about $75,000 in high-cost areas (it could be less in areas where the cost of living is lower). The average increase of experienced well-being associated with incomes beyond that level was precisely zero.

Another interesting study looked at data from millions of public twitter messages and codified the feeling of their tweets, looking at how happiness is affected by time of day. Individuals awaken in a good mood that deteriorates as the day progresses, and people are happier on weekends ([ref](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6051/1878)).

Lastly, a recent study was done showing that although people think repeating experiences such a visiting a museum or restaurant will be less enjoyable than the first time, that's not the case ([ref](https://www.gwern.net/docs/culture/2019-obrien.pdf)).

Interestingly, it turns out that affect also shows adaptation just like life satisfaction. People who undergo various external events end up adapting to the same daily net affect as prior. This highlights two potential ways that adaptation is occurring for both life satisfaction and net affect. The first is acknowledging that attention plays a key role in our happiness - in that even if we suffer a large negative event, it will only occupy a portion of our attention. A second is that we are potentially shifting activities - eg from playing sport before losing a job to strolling in the park after - but with the same result on our happiness. Measures of wellbeing connected to **time use** like this are potentially fruitful.

Measurements taken in real time connect wellbeing to something that matters a lot - how people spend their time. And time use is within our control. So the question becomes what to spend one's time doing.

#### Summary of Affective Balance
So we have two popular types of measurement used so far - we've got data on how people evaluate their lives to be, and what variables correlate with that life satisfaction. And we have data on how people actually report feeling moment to moment. Commonsensically I think people are referring something similar to life satisfaction reports when they talk about pleasure/pain not being happiness/happiness - that is, they think evaluating ones life gives a more accurate picture of happiness than pleasure/pain. On the other hand experienced utility captures a measurement of pleasure and pain in quite an accurate way - rather than people just verbally reporting on their memories, they are telling us what emotions they are actually feeling - positive or negative, pleasurable or painful. So hopefully this article made clear that **there are two main types of happiness - the wellbeing that people experience as they live their lives, and the judgment they make when they evaluate their life.**

> The general conclusion is as clear for well-being as it was for colonoscopies: people's evaluations of their lives and their actual experience may be related, but they are also different. Life satisfaction is not a flawed measure of their experienced well-being, as I thought some years ago. It is something else entirely. - Kahneman

And his conclusion to draw from this is "The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?" Conditions such as paraplegia or marriage are not full-time states, they are only things experienced when cognitive attention is brought to them.

And most interestingly of all this, when people were asked to choose between experienced happiness and remembered happiness, **most people choose experienced happiness for longer timeframes, but not for shorter timeframes** (eg one's lifetime vs next hour). Since people typically live hour-to-hour, these findings imply that **people may end up living a different version of happiness than what they believe is a happy life** ([ref](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2018.1460688?journalCode=rpos20)).

Kahneman's conception of experiencing utility is that experience is a continuous flow of pleasure and pain, and that the happiness of an individual during a period of time is the sum of the momentary utilities over that time period. Several methods have been developed to measure the flow of that utility from moment to moment, and it raises some interesting quirks that make us wonder if we can even trust the Experience Sampling Method.

Emotional well-being (sometimes called hedonic well-being or experienced happiness) refers to the emotional quality of an individual's everyday experience – the frequency and intensity of experiences of joy, fascination, anxiety, sadness, anger, and affection that make one's life pleasant or unpleasant. Life evaluation refers to a person's thoughts about his or her life. Surveys of subjective well-being have traditionally emphasized life evaluation. The most commonly asked question in these surveys is the life satisfaction question: “How satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?” ... Emotional well-being is assessed by questions about the presence of various emotions in the experience of yesterday (e.g., enjoyment, happiness, anger, sadness, stress, worry).

Your life does not exist in some sort of capsule where you can experience your Total pleasures and pains at each point, and trying to maximise pleasures completely or minimise pains completely is a futile endeavour, as you can do neither.

- Life (meaning the totality of thoughts and emotional experiences) is predominantly the lump sum/totality of single events that we do repeatedly/repeat. (ie ferris “life is the sum of the small things that we do repeatedly”)

31/01/17: experience sampling method still being problematic due to it relying on self report.


- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method

What you can control is what you do at each small interval in time. “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.” - Steve Jobs

Goal Setting is a way to verbalise your intuitions of what you think will make you the happiest at each point. Its probably good to do this just to have a concrete anchor to refer back to for justifying the aversive consequences of your behaviour, like work.

There are three sorts of phenomena that you can control in an attempt to improve the overall quality of your life: your brain chemistry, your thought patterns, and your environment.
- The main determinants of brain chemistrys effects on life quality are: serotonin transporter speed (gxe determined), amount of substrate in system (nutrition determined – complex dietary interactions and amino acids etc), not depleting ones neurotransmitters through excessive stimulation (porn, internet, etc), environmental triggers which cause the production and release of neurotransmitters (and absence of negative ones. See below).
- The main determinants of thought patterns: sensory stimulus in immediate environment (so control your environment – the people you surround yourself with, the activities you spend your time on, and your work and living location), and your explanatory style (seligman).
- The main determinants of your environment are: x

The more that an activity is done repeatedly, the more value it has in determining the quality of your life. This likely encapsulates and explains the measurements of subjective wellbeing and why job satisfaction is the #1 correlate with life satisfaction, because you spend a majority of your life working (and sleeping).

The concept of small wins is also valuable to motivate positive habit formations, as it demonstrates that larger and larger rewards can accrue over time with small but regular behaviours.

So basically there are sets of events which give you pleasure, and sets of events which cause you pain. It is a bit more complex, because some events last longer than others, have more intensity, and have the ability to cause reward by surpassing the pain, or have the ability for diminishing returns, etc.

Humans essentially have a set point for wellbeing that they return to relatively quickly after an event of pain or pleasure, which renders the events only moderately valuable, but still worth pursuing. What is a great endeavour I think is trying to modify the setpoint to a different level. I think this set point is titled hedonic tone in psychology.

Happiness is still more illusory than these previous concepts because of Kahneman's distinction between experienced utility and remembered utility.  ---

The affective and life-satisfaction views of happiness differ meaningfully when it comes to certain topics such as the relationship between income and happiness:
"Surveying large numbers of Americans in one case, and what is claimed to be the first globally representative sample of humanity in the other, these studies found that income does indeed correlate substantially (.44 in the global sample), at all levels, with life satisfaction—strictly speaking, a “life evaluation” measure that asks respondents to rate their lives without saying whether they are satisfied. Yet the correlation of household income with the affect measures is far weaker: globally, .17 for positive affect, –.09 for negative affect; and in the United States, essentially zero above $75,000 (though quite strong at low income levels). If the results hold up, the upshot appears to be that income is pretty strongly related to life satisfaction, but weakly related to emotional well-being, at least above a certain threshold.
