<!-- The methods of measuring happiness will differ depending on the area of study, but they all share the same common theme of trying to find an optimal set of outcomes.

Given the time I've spent researching this field, there seems to be three methods used in attempting to figure out what happiness is:
* Happiness Stories
* The scientific method
* Self experimentation

## Happiness Stories

The first and default method that most people rely upon in attempting to form a happiness model about the world is to observe and talk to other people about their beliefs. This can take the form of reading narratives, watching narratives, or simply talking to others.

There is wisdom in the crowd, in history, and in endless quotes which resonate with us personally. I personally believe quotes are quite underrated as a method of communicating value.

The problem with believing to be true merely what others believe to be true is that logically you can inverse their beliefs to be the opposite of what they are and make them false. Take for instance the belief that fruits give you an upset stomach. If everybody believes that this is true, but then you eat fruit and it turns out that this isn't true for you, what good is it to believe what others do? People have also believed a lot of things throughout history that have turned out to be outright false.

So this isn't really a reliable method of discovery, albeit common, but what is useful is that these [folk theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_psychology) may give us hints about which areas to look further into or new ideas to test (via the scientific method and our own self experimentation).

## The Scientific Method

The second method that we can use is the scientific method. That means using a systematic set of observations as an attempt to quantify and arrive at answers which go beyond a single person, and in a more standardised manner. Such tools are valuable because they can overcome biases / blind spots individuals may have by using [larger datasets of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). There are a handful of scientific tools that can be used - questionnaires, brain scans, facial expressions, and others. As you will see, the simple questionnaire has dominated a lot of the happiness research.

We are lucky that we now no longer need to rely on introspecting or making conjectures about happiness, but have the ability to peruse the large body of literature on the subject. This will predominantly be covered in the Maximising Pleasure -> Subjective Wellbeing section.

## Self Experimentation & Self Awareness

The third method is what people use informally, which is relying on their own personal experience as a guide to what makes them happy and unhappy. This is how most people live their lives - reacting to immediate feedback in their environment and deciding what feels good and what feels bad, and ideally changing their behavior accordingly.

The main drawback of this is that we often [lack awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion) into what makes us feel good and bad, and even if we know we don't usually crystallize in language which is helpful for deciding we want more or less of it.

Even if you knew with certainty which happiness stories were accurate, and you replicated the behaviors of beliefs you viewed as happy - there is going to be another subset of people that don't have the same effect. Let's say that you admire and respect the Buddhists and ascetics and lead yourself to believe that what they say is true and that dedicating your life to meditation is the single behaviour which will make you happy, there is going to be a large part of that population which is still "working towards nirvana" and is still unhappy.

This individuality and uniqueness of opinions and preferences is one of the big reasons we can't just base our lives on the opinions and advice of others, non-systematically. If we go about it systematically using the scientific method though, we might be able to give some rigor to the opinions of others.

But again, obviously this is helpful as an imperfect but valuable tool and is also the final metric we use. Who cares what the research says if our individual experience is the opposite? I agree, but what's useful is that science and happiness stories might provide us with ideas to self experiment with to get our own first-hand data. -->




# Summary
So what are we to make of all this?

Our lives are experienced as a continuous flow of pleasurable and painful emotions. By summing those up, we arrive at a happiness index of sorts.



handful of strategies to go about improving our happiness:
- minimise as many physical pains as possible
- selectively add many physical and psychological pains that are *impure*, to increase the total pleasure
- maximise as many physical pleasures as possible: (list)
- maximise as many psychological pleasures as possible: swb and experienced self, socialise as much as possible
- try to maximimise single large events that causing looming psychological pleasures
- minimise as many pains as possible: meditation, and flow state, eliminate rumination
- make life meaningful? by x:
- increase your hedonic tone / resting happiness level by experimenting with various NeuroCosmetics



- A circumstantial improvement of ones life would mean curating circumstances which make pleasures (psych and sens) most likely to occur, pains least likely, maximise flow if necessary and minimise inter-flow states of rumination. A sort of self-help/self-sufficiency theory of happiness.
- Some people have good circumstances naturally (rich and attractive) while others have to work hard towards them.
