### Life Satisfaction (LS)
There have been a lot of findings in this field of research. The findings of these studies are quite interesting, and many commonsense notions about happiness appear to be inaccurate. Here is a list of things that do or don't correlate with happiness / unhappiness:

#### Strong Predictors
* **Mental Health** is the strongest individual predictor of LS ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5511887/))
* **Love and marriage** and happiness ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-019), [ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022100031004001)). Romantic relationships can be stressful. Nevertheless, people consistently rate being in love as one of the most critical ingredients of happiness. Married people are happier than people who are single or divorced. However, the casual relations are unclear - it may be that happiness causes marital satisfaction more than martial satisfaction promotes happiness. Perhaps people who are happy tend to have better intimate relationships and more stable marriages, while people who are unhappy have more difficulty finding and keeping mates.
* The **fulfillment of basics** needs such as food and shelter ([ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0307-6))
* **[Job satisfaction](https://adamdemirel.com/job-satisfaction)** ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00541-019)). People often complain about their work. Therefore, one might not expect work to be a key source of happiness. But it is. It's not as critical as love or marriage, but job satisfaction has a substantial association with general happiness. Studies also show that **unemployment** has strong negative effects on SWB ([ref](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225510/subjective_wellbeing_employment.pdf)). It's difficult to sort out whether job satisfaction causes happiness or vice versa, but evidence suggests that causation flows both ways.
* **Genetics** ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16219116), [ref](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20150926115101/http://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/research/wellbeing/causes_and_effects_of_wellbeing.asp)) - account for about 30-40% variance ([ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0307-6)) (which is a *lot* in happiness research - more than anything else). The best predictor of individuals future happiness is their past happiness. Some people seem destined to be happy and others unhappy, regardless of their triumphs or setbacks. The limited influence of life events is demonstrated with the hedonic treadmill (which I'll talk about further below).
  * [Sleep Quality](https://adamdemirel.com/sleep) ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/live-well-for-less/living-well-index))
* An **Optimistic mindset** in explaining negative setbacks ([ref](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26123.Learned_Optimism)) - ie ones beliefs about themselves, others, and the world, and the absence of cognitive distortions/learned helplessness.
* The **absence of smoking** cigarettes/quitting smoking improves happiness *significantly* ([ref](https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/26/2/195.abstract))
* **Personality** and happiness ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-11667-032), [ref](http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/3_happiness/Steel2008_5FM_and_happiness_psych_bull.pdf)) - with the largest effect being due to *extroversion*, with agreeableness, conscientiousness, self-esteem, and optimism also being strongly related. ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00541-009)) Peoples genetic predispositions account for a substantial portion of the variance in happiness. How? By shaping one's personality and temperament, which are known to be heritable.
* Being **sick/disabled** highly correlates with unhappiness (ibid)
* **Debt** and unhappiness ([ref1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16649863), [ref2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167487005000103))
* **Being poor** (separate to being rich) ([ref](https://adamdemirel.com/job-satisfaction/#section-50), [ref](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021381616824), [ref](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/williamtov/pubs/2009_DienerKahnemanEtAl.pdf)). Wellbeing rises steeply from dire poverty to an income of ~20k per year (depending on the country), and then a slow trend upwards from to to ~50k/yr.

The list of factors that turn out to have fairly strong associations with happiness is surprisingly short. The key ingredients of happiness appear to involve love, work, and genetic predisposition expressed through personality.

#### Moderate Predictors
* **Self reported Health** and happiness (~.32) ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-018), [ref](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/media/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Kahneman_2006_Measurement.pdf)). Good health, may not by itself produce happiness because people tend to take good health for granted. May explain why researchers only find a moderate positive correlation between health status and SWB.
* **Social Activity/Sociability** and happiness ([ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00501001.x)). Humans are social animals. As such, interpersonal relations *do* appear to contribute to people's happiness. Those who are satisfied with their social support and friendship networks and those who are socially active report above-average levels of happiness. Furthermore, people who are exceptionally happy tend to report greater satisfaction with their social relations than those who are average or low in SWB. People who had deep, substantive convos were happier than those who mostly engaged in small talk.
* **Health & Happiness of close relatives** ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/live-well-for-less/living-well-index)) ([ref](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/media/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Kahneman_2006_Measurement.pdf))
* **Religion** and happiness ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-019)), though this may be due to religious attendance and not religious belief ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19142047))
* **Mindfulness** ([ref](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2003_BrownRyan.pdf))
* Participating in a **group sport** - partly by identifying with a group ([ref](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487012000402))
* Above includes whether you **live alone** and **eat alone** often ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/~/media/Files/S/Sainsburys/living-well-index/Sainsburys%20Living%20Well%20Index%20Wave%204%20Jun%202019%20FV.pdf))
* **Sex life** ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/live-well-for-less/living-well-index))
* **Frequent verbal expressions of positive emotions** ([ref](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/media/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Kahneman_2006_Measurement.pdf))
* **Internet users** are more satisfied with their lives than non internet users ([ref](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297721767_Life_Satisfaction_Of_The_Internet_And_Non-Internet_Users_In_Thailand))
* **Chronotype**: Morning Larks have higher LS than Night Owls ([ref](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07420528.2012.685671), [ref](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07420528.2013.840786))
* **Being able to regulate negative emotions** ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-011-9312-4))
* **Height** ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693261))
* **Appreciation** which includes being present, self/social comaparison, gratitude, and interpersonal appreciation ([ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886912000888))
* **Living with your partner** ([ref](https://aifs.gov.au/publications/life-satisfaction-across-life-course-transitions))

#### Weak Predictors
* **Leisure Satisfaction**: Being satisfied with how you spend your leisure time ([ref](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/11745398.2010.9686871))
* There is a positive correlation between **income** and SWB, but its weak (between .12 and .20) ([ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00501001.x)). Though it's high between very low income and unhappiness. In other words, money doesn't make you happier unless you're below the poverty line (can't pay for food, shelter, clothing, and sanitation). For a full exploration see [here](https://adamdemirel.com/job-satisfaction/#section-50).
* **Video game** use in young people improves well being slightly ([ref](https://mindfulnessinschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/video-games-and-wellbeing.pdf))
* **Part-time workers** are very slightly happier than full-time (ibid)
* **Home Ownership** is positively correlated with life satisfaction ([ref](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24719087)) (but more important for females than males) - however, its effect on well-being seems to depend on *income level* (less important for lower income), potentially due to aspiration preferences ([ref](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254420231_Homeownership_and_subjective_well-being)). Some seemingly better research suggests that homeownership improves *housing satisfaction* but not life satisfaction ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11205-010-9607-6)) and that they might actually not be happier at all due to spending their time in worse ways ([ref](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1877163)). Also having a **home loan** has a negative effect on life satisfaction ([ref](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24719087)).
* Mild effects for donating to charity ([ref](https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/#if-you-gave-money-to-charity-would-it-make-you-more-satisfied-or-less), [ref](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/giving-and-happiness/))
* Your **country** weakly predicts happiness (<.10) - ranging from 6.5 (for brazil) - 7.5/10 (for finland) ([ref](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/)).
* **Working 4 days > 5** days increases life satisfaction by 5% ([ref](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/work-less-get-more-new-zealand-firms-four-day-week-an-unmitigated-success))
* The personality trait **Zest** due to living in the present ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zest_(positive_psychology)#Life_satisfaction_and_Zest))
* **Healthy eating** ([ref](http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&context=econ_workingpapers), [ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019566631630931X), [ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-019-09748-7))
* The BIG5 personality traits extraversion, conscientousness, and neuroticism ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23075216))
* **Yoga** ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10846636))

#### Neutral Predictors
* **Physical Attractiveness** is unrelated to happiness ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1995-40426-001))
* **Intelligence** is unrelated to happiness ([ref](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2143374))
* **Parenthood** is unrelated to happiness ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-00473-000)). Compared to childless couples, parents worry more and experience more marital problems. Apparently, the good and bad aspects of parenthood balance each other out. The evidence indicates that people who have children are neither more nor less happy than people without children (Argyle, 2001). Other research shows a sharp drop in happiness post birth ([ref](https://aifs.gov.au/publications/life-satisfaction-across-life-course-transitions)).
* **Gender** does not correlate with happiness ([ref](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327582ijpr0403_7?journalCode=hjpr20)) - men and women are equally happy. (this is a separate measurement from depression incidence)
* **Age** doesn't correlate at all according to some research (<1% variance>) ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-03362-000), [ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691618765171)). Other research demonstrates a U curve, meaning a drop in happiness mid life before a raise in late life ([ref](https://aifs.gov.au/publications/life-satisfaction-across-life-course-transitions)).

As you can see, quite a number of factors that you might expect to be influential appear to bear little or no relationship to general happiness. And you can find study correlations between all sorts of things ([ref](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/33KewgYhNSxFpbpXg/scientific-self-help-the-state-of-our-knowledge), [ref](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4su/how_to_be_happy/)) - [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction) did a great writeup.

#### Summary of the Life Satisfaction Research
As mentioned, [Ed Diener](https://eddiener.com/articles#2019) pioneered and did a lot of the important work in the field. Three great reviews are [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0307-6), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6329388/#S7title), and [here](https://eddiener.com/articles/925). His main findings are that life satisfaction reports tend to be stable over time. Genetics account for 30-40% of the variance in happiness ratings, caused by having a happy/unhappy personality - specifically extraversion being good, and neuroticism being bad. The cause of genes and personality on wellbeing are perhaps the only major long term causes. But 60-70% is also environmental and within our control. Those environmental variables are fulfilling our basic needs (food and shelter), psychological needs (eg autonomy), social needs, and experiencing respect from others. Income is important up until a point, because it helps us fulfill our basic needs.

Beyond basic needs, life circumstances also affect our Life Satisfaction ratings. People are happier one year before marriage and stay happy for ~2yr after before returning to baseline. Having children does not improve life satifaction. Widowhood, unemployment, and disability all have strong negative effects on life satisfaction.

This returning to baseline happens with most life events, and is called *set point theory*. It is believed to be biologically determined. But some serious negative events such as unemployment, divorce, and widhood do not return to baseline.


// todo: rwerite all of above with clarity, now that research is fresh in my mind

#### Issues with SWB / Conclusions about SWB
"researcher initiated manipulations of context and mood" + errors by participants but still 0.77 correlation ([ref](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/media/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Kahneman_2006_Measurement.pdf))

So Diener said that they continue to study life satisfaction reports based on the idea that "how each person thinks and feels about his or her life is important" ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-16279-000)). Indeed, life satisfaction reports tend to correlate around .7 with reports of emotions over time ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-00334-001)) - at least in this short 3 week study.

But prima facie, there does seem to be some obvious deficits with measuring happiness like this ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6329388/)). Subjects may:



* Be dishonest in their reports
* Be innacurate in their reports
* Decieve themselves about their own wellbeing
* Be primed prior to the question, eg by the weather.
* Have their life satisfaction reports influenced by their current mood. (shown to not have a large effect ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936533))
* Unwilling to provide an honest answer to researchers
* Interpret the meaning of the question differently
* Be  influenced by the order the survey questions are asked
* Be primed by the environment ([ref](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=870494)) - eg finding a coin before filling out the survey substantially raised life satisfaction ([ref](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/media/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Kahneman_2006_Measurement.pdf))

But the biggest issue in the whole life satisfaction rating area of research is the accuracy of the measurement. Due to it being a cognitive rather than emotional account - meaning participants reflect and then rate, there is no reason to believe it's very accurate or that humans are able to do this well.

If you ask somebody to rate their life on a scale of 1-10, this is a single retrospective judgement at one moment in time and it is impossible that participants are able to accurately remember every single emotion they have ever experienced, and sum them up in their head, do a calculation on them, and output an accurate reflection of their life. Or even over a shorter timespan, eg for a day. It is infeasible we are able to conduct a comprehensive search of the relevant memories and aggregate them into a meaningful report ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6329388/)). And research shows people make judgements too quickly for it to even be feasible that they are searching their memory ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12405138)) - people make the judgements almost instantenously.

It's been suggested that perhaps people are recalling a life satisfaction judgement stored in memory, or using quick heuristics that enable fast but still potentially accurate reports, but it's still unlikely they are very accurate ([ref](http://www.economics-ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2012-28/references/Schwarz1999)).

What's more likely happening is that the participants current mood is influencing their well-being judgement, as research has demonstrated is the case ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6329388/)). Unfortunately the sample sizes of the current studies demonstrating this are quite small but it is the most likely explanation. Also some later research suggested that the effects of current mood on life satisfaction judgements are small ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:SOCI.0000003801.89195.bc)). But again, small sample sizes.

Although one promising feature of life satisfaction reports are that they are relatively stable across time - they correlate at 0.77 when measured again after 4 weeks which isn't as high as some other measures in psychology but is still quite reassuring. So it might be reliable enough for many purposes, but current mood and context may fluctuate day to day which may alter individual reports ([ref](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/media/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Kahneman_2006_Measurement.pdf)). So although there are reasons to be skeptical of the complete reliability of life satisfaction reports, they are not grounds for dismissing it completely. But they still fall short as a measure of real-time experiences.

So it is not clear according to the *research* whether life satisfaction measures can be completely relied upon. In fact, that's why the subjective wellbeing research is split into life satisfaction and affective balance measures, which I'll cover below. But as I mentioned, to me it seems extremely unlikely that we are accurately refecting our emotional life in our cognitive judgements due to the complexity and difficulty of doing so, so the life satisfaction research to me seems completely useless regardless of how widely it's used and studied.
