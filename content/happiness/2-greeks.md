# Ancient Greek History
There is other happiness historical data I could cover, but I think a lot of the patterns that an be captured are highlighted well by the Ancient Greeks - in particular three schools of thought. I think the three most influential are *Epicureanism, Cyrenaicism*, and *Stoicism*. The reason being that they were close in time to eachother were in part responding to and opposing eachother.

Besides attempting to extract themes from reviewing these schools, i also don't  think any account of happiness would be complete without covering them in basic detail.

## Epicureanism

Epicureanism ([ref](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/e/epicurus/menoeceus/), [ref](http://classics.mit.edu/Epicurus/princdoc.html), [ref](https://philpapers.org/rec/COOETC-5)) is the school of thought founded on the writings of the individual [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus). He is considered a **Hedonist**, an important term which frames the position I'm arguing for. The pop culture usage of the word hedonism usually refers to *decadent hedonism*, which is more related to the indulgence of Cyrenaicism as you will see. A lot of scholars effortfully defend Epicureanism from falling under this same label, and have done so by calling him a *negative hedonist* - negative meaning a focus on the removal of pain rather than addition of pleasure.

There are two main principles to Epicureanism. The first principle is that the *removal* of basic physical needs and desires results in the happiest state possible. The second principle is the necessity of friendship to happiness.

In regards to the first principle, he noted that there is a small list of innate needs which are required for survival, and once you removed the pain that comes with those "basal desires", it results in what he calls *static pleasures* (or what scholars call *negative pleasure*). This state of *freedom from desire and discomfort* is results in what he calls *ataraxia*. This ataraxic state is the absence of any physical pains, or physical pleasure, and is the peak of happiness in his view. This is opposed to adding pleasure on top of a neutral state, or doing something that doesn't remove an innate need (such as drinking alcohol), resulting in what he calls *kinetic pleasure* (or what scholars call *positive pleasure*).  The simple  needs which are needed to be removed include the need to sleep, to eat, to drink, and to avoid physical pains.

Secondly, although not a physical pain like his others, he  emphasized the necessity of friendship as it is only through them that freedom from anxiety and "peace of mind" is possible.

His argument for why negative pleasures are more important than positive pleasures is because he thought positive pleasures leads to further desire for them, which if cannot be attained leads to pain. He wrote his views in large part as a reaction to the Cyrenaics which I mentioned emphasized the addition of physical pleasures. His argument is also based on there being natural desires necessary for the maintenance of life, which manifest as bodily discomforts, which when resolved result in happiness. He thought these were separate and more important than other unnecessary and trivial desires.

Whether ot not this is true, what he understood is that desire only arises from a particular deficiency, and that pleasure is the result of satisfying said deficiency. This is simple but also sophisticated - he highlights that the removal of physical and mental pains is the goal of life, because once you remove them, you no longer desire pleasure or the removal of pain any more. Everything we are motivated to do is to achieve freedom from psychological pain (like fear) and physical pain (like hunger), and once we do this we don't feel the need to continue seeking something which is absent to add to our lives. In concrete terms: **We only have the need for pleasure when we feel a pain, but whenever we do not feel pain then we no longer need pleasure**.

### The Problems With Epicureanism
There are two major problems with Epicureanism: the first is that he fails to weight the duration and quantity of pleasure and pain in affecting our total happiness. The second is that he fails to acknowledge mental pleasures/pains.

So firstly, he didn't  believe that longer pleasures were superior to shorter ones. If you accept the premise that pleasure is good, and pain is bad (which I'll argue for shortly), mathematically the more  pleasure and the less pain you experience, the better. Failing to weight the duration of an experience in assessing it is a common bias which psychologists call [duration neglect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duration_neglect).

The other major problematic aspect is that he acknowledges physical pleasures and pains but neglects mental pleasures and pains. He actually does make an exception for friendship as you read, which is odd because if he admits that there exists mental pains such as anxiety which friendship can remove, then he must leave open the possibility for many other mental pains and that the removal of them is just as important as physical pains. More importantly, he argued that once you remove physical pains this is the peak of happiness. Obviously this is wrong because you can the absence of physical pains but the presence of mental pains such as sadness, anger, boredom, fear, etc.

Our time needs to be used doing something and it can't completely be used removing physical pains, because such needs are finite. What will result are a list of mental pains which have the ability to affect our total happiness.

What he did highlight is that one potential way to improve our happiness is be minimizing physical pains.

## Cyrenaicism
In contrast to the negative hedonism of  Epicurus is the Positive Hedonism of the Cyrenaics.
Cyrenaicism is a school of thought which focused on the addition of physical pleasures, making these two diametrically opposed.

The Cyrenaics was a school of thought lead by the figure [Aristippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristippus).

![aristippus](/images/happiness/aristippus.jpg)

He believed that happiness was achieved by maximizing physical pleasures beyond a neutral sated state - such as by eating extravagant food, drinking alcohol, or indulging in sexual pleasures. And consuming as many of these as one could. This is the pop culture conception of hedonism - engaging in pleasures of the senses.

Unlike Epicurus acknowledge that certain mental pleasures existed, such as 'knowledge' which was highlighted by Aristotle. But he thought that physical pleasures were of more importance than mental pleasures due to them being more visceral and greater in intensity, which is hard to deny.

He also thought that physical pleasures should be more sought after due to their ease and certainty of attainment in comparison to the distance and difficult mental pleasures, caused by for example the mastery of a skill. This uncertainty is understandable once the writing is placed in his historical context - written at a time of war and short life expectancy, thus a perspective of scarcity. When life expectancy is relatively secured by a modern lifestyle, this is less uncertain.

### The Problems With Cyrenaicism
He commits a similar error to Epicurus which is that although he accurately acknowledges that physical pleasures are more intense than mental pleasures, he neglects the ability for mental pleasures to persist over time which could lead to a large pleasure total. Physical pleasures are only experienced in the present, whereas psychological ones are exist in the past, present, and future, even if less intense.

But what he did highlight is that one potential way to improve our happiness is to maximize physical pleasures, and we can also see that another way is to maximize mental pleasures.


## Stoicism
![zeno](/images/happiness/zeno.jpg)

The third and also negative hedonist school of thought which aims to minimize pain were the  [Stoics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism), lead by the individual Zeno.

The Stoics aimed to live a life of peace from pains, similar to the Epicureans. They thought that the presence of any physical pains or pleasures would disrupt their mental tranquility. But unlike the Epicureans who neglected mental pains, the Stoic form of *Ataraxia* includes both physical pains as well as mental pains such as desire, boredom, hatred, and guilt.

So the Stoics have the added advantage over the Epicureans of realizing that our mind itself may be a source of pleasure or pain, which is aptly emphasized in the quote:

> “We are not troubled by things but the opinion which we have of things.” — Epictetus

### The Problems With Stoicism
The same issue occurs with Stoicism as the two other schools - that is they have recognized some improvements to wellbeing - namely minimizing physical pains and mental pains. But they have neglected the possibility of physical pleasures and mental pleasures in mathematically increasing our total amount of pleasures/pains.

So just like the Epicureans neglected mental pleasures and pains, and just like the Cyrenaics neglected all mental pains while recognized physical pleasures, the Stoics recognize mental pains but fail to acknowledge physical pleasures.
