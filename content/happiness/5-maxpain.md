# Maximizing Pains
Just like it is unproductive to try to improve happiness by minimizing pleasures, it is also unproductive to try to improve happiness by maximizing pains.

Though there is one crucial difference between these two, and that is that pains are often impure. Remember that or purity or impurity is whether a pain/pleasure is followed by the opposite kind. Even if pain is immediately bad in the short term, they often have the possibility of being followed by pleasures which result in the episode being a net positive.

Granted, pleasures are still what is intrinsically good, and pains are still what's intrinsically bad. But we have just acknowledged that sometimes pains can be followed by greater pleasures. So you can see that pleasures/pains are not binary, in episodes, they are functions that change over time.

The main figure that represents this school of thought was Friedrich Nietzsche, which is attributed with the famous quote we have all heard that aptly summarizes this succinctly:

> "No pain, no gain"

Obviously pain is not a necessary condition for all physical or mental pleasures. Not every pleasure has a pain that motivates you to seek it - for example you can serendipitously stumble upon the aesthetic pleasure of a flower without planning to do so. But pain is a necessary condition for some pleasures.

Nietzsche thought that happiness didn't come from escaping every pain we have, but instead cultivating them/using them to gain pleasure, because pains are "flagposts" which draw our attention to what needs to be done. If something is causing you pain, even though that pain is bad, that is a hint that you should change your behavior or otherwise in order to remove it. It is a very life affirmative philosophy which attempts to embrace consciousness and all of its constituents.

This fits with what we noted about the evolutionary function of the basic drives like hunger, thirst, heat, and tiredness, etc: that they are motivations which are seeking homeostasis.

But rather than pains simply being signals that we can use to remove them to return back to a neutral state like Epicurus thought, Nietzsche believed that **the greatest pleasures** were produced as a result of not avoiding pains but using them as guides to what needs to be solved. In this way he thinks that pains are trails to large pleasures.

Interesting and related to this is the concept in biology called [Hormesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis). Hormesis is when an organism gains a net positive response to a short term stressor. Examples include:
* Exercising causes physiological stress in the short term but larger breathing capacity and improved cardiovascular system function as a result
* Extreme heat/cold stress (ie Saunas/Cryotherapy) are stressful in the short term but have net benefits
* Alcohol/Fermentation potentially has a role here, by being mildly toxic in the short term but beneficial in the long
* Even vegetables are believed to exert their positive effects via hormesis. Plants contain phytonutrients which are toxic to small insects, but are present in such small amounts that humans are able to fight them off and develop a various of beneficial systems to offset the periodic consumption
* Allergen immunotherapy
* [Radiation](https://gettingstronger.org/about-this-blog/)

These are just a few interesting examples that highlight how initially stressful / painful events can result in net gains. Actually the examples above of hormesis are related to biochemical stress, the more general term which captures psychological, and others is [Eustress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress) - meaning "good stress", or for our purposes "good pain". In exercise terminology, the positive response to exercise is called [Supercompensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercompensation). Recently, the popular author Nassim Taleb came up with the term [Antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility) which also attempts to describe the same phenomena unknowingly.

In support of this idea was Edwin Locke's functional account of emotions in the previous section. He thought that all emotions, including negative ones, served a specific function. Whether that supports the idea that the greatest pleasures are impure pain episodes is questionable though.

There aren't any extremely actionable lessons from this section. What we highlighted is that the curve of emotions is a tricky one, and sometimes you might want to strategically expose yourself to pains in the short term if they are followed by a greater amount of pleasure in the long term - or simply: delay gratification. Not all short term pains are net bad, and they are often a signal to a problem that needs to be solved which can remove the pain, and add pleasure ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being_contributing_factors#Suffering)). But don't do so at the exclusion of pleasure.

How you figure out what those pains are is the trickier question. Our list of pain episodes is probably a good place to start. To begin with, most of these are relatively minor intensity pleasures and pains, and are relatively pure. The best thing to do is to look at which *seem* to be relatively large episodes, and then try to work out whether they are impure. Mastery and achievement seems like a likely candidate here - usually requiring upfront suffering with the potential for a [big payoff later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value). Obviously we are just predicting here and this is very imperfect, which we will come back to in the following section. Maybe the biggest take away is just that this allows us to update our model to include impure pains.
