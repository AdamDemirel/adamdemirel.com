# Maximising Pains
Although for the same reasons as above it makes no sense to try to optimize happiness by directly maximising pains as much as possible (especially not severe negative emotions) such as:

What some figures did note is that the individual experiences of pain are not necessarily always overall bad, even if immediately bad in the short term. What I mean by bad is that just like we acknowledged that some pleasures are impure, so may pains be. Some pains have the possibility of being followed by pleasures and thus can potentially result in a greater pleasure total.

At the end of the day, positive emotions are still what's intrinsically valuable, and negative emotions are still what's intrinsically undesirable, but we've just acknowledged that small negative emotions can sometimes be followed by greater positive emotions. This plays into what we mentioned in the Hedonism section - that pleasures/pains are not sinewave but functions which change over time.

The main figure that represents this school of thought was Friedrich Nietzsche, which is attributed with the famous quote we have all heard that aptly summarises this:

> "No pain, no gain"

Obviously pain isn't a necessary condition for all pleasure, but it is for some. This applies to both physical and psychological pains. Not every pleasure has a pain that motivates you to seek it, for example you can seredipitously stumble upon the aesthetic pleasure of a flower without planning to do so.

Nietzsche thought that happiness didn't come from escaping every pain we have, but instead cultivating them/using them to gain pleasure, because pains are "flagposts" which draw our attention to what needs to be done. If something is causing you pain, even though that pain is bad, that is a hint that you should change your behavior or otherwise in order to remove it. It is a very life affirmative philosophy which attempts to embrace consciousness and all of its constituents.

This makes sense when you think about the function of hunger, thirst, heat, and tiredness have on motivation: trying to return back to homeostasis by eating, drinking, etc. But rather than the pains just being signals we can use to remove them and get back to neutral, like the Epicureans thought, Nietzsche believed that **the greatest pleasures** came about as a result of not avoiding pains but using them as guides to what needs to be solved. In this way he thinks they are trails to large positive experiences.

Interesting and related to this is the concept in biology called [Hormesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis). Hormesis is when an organism gains a net positive response to a short term stressor. Examples include:
* Exercising causes physiological stress in the short term but larger breathing capacity and improved cardiovascular system function as a result
* Extreme heat/cold stress (ie Saunas/Cryotherapy) are stressful in the short term but have net benefits
* Alcohol/Fermentation potentially has a role here, by being mildly toxic in the short term but beneficial in the long
* Even vegetables are believed to exert their positive effects via hormesis. Plants contain phytonutrients which are toxic to small insects, but are present in such small amounts that humans are able to fight them off and develop a various of beneficial systems to offset the periodic consumption

Some more general [examples](https://gettingstronger.org/about-this-blog/) of hormetism are:
* Attempting to improve eyesight without glasses
* Overcoming psychological challenges
* Improving immune system
* Allergen immunotherapy
* The positive effects of radiation
* Improving [addictions](https://gettingstronger.org/2010/04/overcoming-addictions/)

These are just a few interesting examples that highlight how initially stressful / painful events can result in net gains. Actually the examples above of hormesis are related to biochemical stress, the more general term which captures psychological, and others is [Eustress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress) - meaning "good stress", or for our purposes "good pain". In exercise terminology, the positive response to exercise is called [Supercompensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercompensation). Recently, the popular author Nassim Taleb came up with the term [Antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility) which also attempts to describe the same phenomena unknowingly.

In support of Nietzsche's idea about pains being functional, leading emotion psychologists such as Edwin Locke also agree (2). Edwins research is that *emotions are the form of taking automatic, subconscious value appraisals*. He thinks that every emotion involves a specific type of value appraisal, few being:
* Fear is experienced during a perceived threat to one's life or well-being (or that of a loved one)
* Anxiety is experienced during a perceived threat involves one's self-esteem, and involves more uncertainty over the threat
* Sadness is experienced at the loss of a value
* Depression is a more intense form of sadness involving self-deprecation and a sense of hopelessness
* Anger is experienced when a goal is blocked
* Guilt is experienced when one violates their moral values
* Pleasure is experienced when one has gained or possessed a value
* Pride is experienced during an achievement due to one's own efforts
* Admiration is experienced during the appraisal of another person's positive achievements
* Happiness is the state of non-contradictory joy, and more intense than pleasure

He thinks every emotion has the same pattern (excluding biological imbalances): an object in the world (a thing, person, action, event, idea, memory, or previous emotion) -> cognition (percetion of the object and associations) -> value appraisal (measuring the object by whether some value is being fulfilled or threatened in some way) -> resulting subconscious emotion (which is either a positive or negative state). He even acknowledges that emotions differ in intensity, eg: hate is stronger than disliking. He says the middle stages (cognition -> value appraisal) are automatic and subconscious so what is consciously experienced is object -> emotion. He makes the interesting point that a mood is an enduring emotional state, and it endures because the object (eg a bad boss) is always present, or because causes endure based on memory (eg losing a good job) or rumination (replaying triggering thoughts).

There aren't any extremely actionable takeaways from this section, what we was learnt is that the bellcurve of emotions is a tricky one and sometimes you might want to expose yourself to pains to receive following pleasures (commonsensically: delay gratification). Not all short term pains are bad, and pains are usually a signal to a problem that needs to be solved which can remove the pain, but just make sure you're not doing so at the full exclusion of pleasure. Or even better, the result in removing the pains may result in pleasure gains, and if you get it right, maximising the right negative emotions can lead to much greater pleasure.
