### Impact Bias
// move this to predicted utility


Another sad fact of reality and related bias is the tendency for humans to overestimate the intensity and duration of pleasures (fortunately and pains), what's caleed the [impact bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_bias). This is related to the psychoanalyst Lacan's concept of [Jouissance](https://www.lacan.com/forced.htm) - wher we get a milder "jouissance obtained" in place of the full satisfaction of a "jouissance expected" - so attaining pleasures or fulfilling our desire is never as great as we expect.

On a more macro scale, this reminds me of when you read stories of traditionally successful figures and they often remark at ages 40-50 that they realised that there's no moment of "complete happiness/satisfaction" that you reach, like they expected before they were successful, the ride just continues on. This is both terrifying and enlightening - it doesn't really matter what big events we do or don't get, and the smaller events are within our control. Also, again it doesn't matter if we return to baseline, the pains/pleasure preceding that drop to baseline are still valid experiences, regardless of experiencing some *grand cognitive satisfaction*.
