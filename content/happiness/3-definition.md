# What is Happiness (Theoretically)?
You can see how through unfolding what the basic principles of these three Greek schools are, we can extract out some common patterns for categorizing methods of improving happiness. The first theme is that there are physical pains and pleasures, and there are mental pains and pleasures. The other theme is that you can aim to maximize or minimize these various states. This leads us to a basic 4 by 4 matrix of possible ways to improve our happiness, or a 2 by 2 if we combine the physical and mental for the sake of simplicity:
1. Minimising Pleasures
2. Maximising Pains
3. Minimising Pains
4. Maximising Pleasures

There is a fifth way to improve it not highlighted by the Greeks, and that is by modify our resting setpoint of happiness, which I will come back to later.

But before we fully take the assumption for granted that pleasures are good, and pains are bad, and we should be maximizing and minimizing them, let's explore that.

The question of how to be "happy" or live a happy life has been a question plaguing humans since time immemorial.

Interestingly, even the most simple of organisms, the *Amoeba*, seems to display a "pain-like" and "pleasure-like" response, moving closer and feeding off of nearby foods and light, and avoiding noxious chemicals and other objects ([4](https://www.britannica.com/science/nervous-system)). All that and the amoeba is believed to be related to the earliest forms of life 800 million years ago! So the motivation of organisms to be pleasure seekers and pain avoiders it not a new phenomena.

Throughout most of animal history, animals would use their immediate environment as a guide to their behavior - they would live their life completely immersed in each moment, responding to threats of danger and seeking food to keep themselves alive long enough to spread their genes.

But at an unbeknown point, early humans developed enough sentience to begin asking *how they could be better* and *what they should do with the finite amount of time they're endowed*?

When you look at how people today actually behave, the rewards they seek and punishments they avoid are not based on some complex forms of reasoning and analysis like here, but are usually based on mere emotional response shortly preceding each behavior in time - which is predicted by [learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning). That is - people have conditioned responses to increase or decrease certain behaviors which have been previously associated with rewards or punishments. Some would even [strongly](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dwegner/files/minds_best_trick.pdf) argue that they have no free will.

Although it seems like human experience is infinitely diverse, due to the basic universal biology and evolution we all share, there is a finite list of less than 50 *types* of pleasure or pain episodes/experiences that we can all have. Anything we can think of as pleasurable or painful can be captured under this list. If you can find any others [let me know](https://adamdemirel.com):

## The Purpose of Pleasures and Pains
So given this list and our perspective on the pleasures and pains available, we can look over this list and see a trend. Even if not immediately evident, most if not all of these serve an evolutionary purpose - as Epicurus hinted at.

I'm not going to run through the whole list for the sake of brevity, but you can see how the obvious physical pleasures and pains serve our immediate biological needs for homeostasis: hydration, food, sleep, a stable temperature, cleanliness, freedom from physical pains of various sorts, indicating threats with visual disgust, loudness, and fear. The pain motivates us to avoid some situation and the pleasure is the reward when get for removing that pain.

Beyond the physical needs, the mental needs also fall into a handful of categories - we have a lot of needs for social cohesion and approval which serves at the [group selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection) level - namely we have benefited from being in social groups for our survival. Love and cuteness are also bonding emotions - cuteness makes us care for babies, and love [bonds partners](https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199783267.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199783267) to stick around long enough to raise offspring.

We are attracted to novelty and change because of the potential for discovering new rewards in the environment. Similarly, we are attracted to learning of various sorts because it allows us to [observe others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_learning) and acquire solutions to potential survival and reproduction problems without trying it first hand.

In regards to control, it has been shown that humans have a strong innate need for control, over themselves and their environment ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11554650), [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory)). Meaning is an interesting one that we will come back to later. Chemical pleasures are man made hacks we have into our biology which don't really fit with the rest of the model, besides endogenously produced which usually offset pain - like runners high.

This gives us an interesting and intuitive model to think about individual episodes of pleasures and pains. The model is that we evolved to experienced pleasure because it serves an evolutionary function: to motivate and reward us for experiences that increase our odds at survival and reproduction. The same fundamental motivation for nearly everything else. In fact, a Norwegian biologist Bjørn Grinde wrote a whole book about trying to use evolution as a guide for living, called [Darwinian Happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinian_Happiness).

In regards to basic emotions like anger at the frustration of a goal, or joy at the attainment of one, leading emotion psychologists such as Edwin Locke also support this ([ref](https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199928309.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199928309)). Modern emotion researchers think that *emotions are the form of taking automatic, subconscious value appraisals*, with a specific value appraisal serving specific functions, some being:
* Fear is experienced during a perceived threat to one's life or well-being (or that of a loved one)
* Anxiety is experienced during a perceived threat involves one's self-esteem, and involves more uncertainty over the threat
* Sadness is experienced at the loss of a value
* Depression is a more intense form of sadness involving self-deprecation and a sense of hopelessness
* Anger is experienced when a goal is blocked
* Guilt is experienced when one violates their moral values
* Pleasure is experienced when one has gained or possessed a value
* Pride is experienced during an achievement due to one's own efforts
* Admiration is experienced during the appraisal of another person's positive achievements
* Happiness is the state of non-contradictory joy, and more intense than pleasure

He thinks every emotion has the same pattern (excluding chemical imbalances): an object in the world (a thing, person, action, event, idea, memory, or previous emotion) -> cognition (perception of the object and associations) -> value appraisal (measuring the object by whether some value is being fulfilled or threatened in some way) -> resulting subconscious emotion (which is either a positive or negative state). He even acknowledges that emotions differ in intensity, eg: hate is stronger than disliking. He says the middle stages (cognition -> value appraisal) are automatic and subconscious so what is consciously experienced is object -> emotion. He makes the interesting point that a mood is an enduring emotional state, and it endures because the object (eg a bad boss) is always present, or because causes endure based on memory (eg losing a good job) or rumination (replaying triggering thoughts).

## Again, What is Happiness?
So what we know is that we evolved, and that so did our basic emotions as well as our experiences of pleasure and pain. Those pleasure and pains most likely evolved to serve our evolutionary needs, which are finite. So we have a finite amount of pleasures and pains, some mental and some physical. Pleasures are subjectively experienced as good, rewarding, and something we should approach and seek more of. Pains are subjectively experienced as bad, punishing, and something which we should avoid.

At it's core, pleasures are intrinsically good, and pains are intrinsically bad. These are [fundamental dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)) that all human experience can be evaluated on. Anything else we can think of as valuable can be compared with pleasure and pain and seen to be measured by it, and inferior than it.


In summary of everything above, we've concluded that **a happy life can be evaluated by how much pleasure and pain it contains, due to them being the only intrinsic values. The more pleasure and the less pain, the better the life. Those pleasures/pains can be physical or psychological. And pleasures/pains differ in their intensity, duration, certainty, repeatability, and purity.** This means that to model how to improve happiness, we need to know how best to maximize pleasure and minimize pain.

<!-- ### purpose of thoughts
- memory -> then emotional response
- affective forecast /prediction / visualisation -> emotional response
in comparison to environmental triggers/cues -> self talk -> emotional response

emotional response -> behavioral response (or extinguishment of) -> feedback loop into A
-- this whole model has a biological substrate,
-- emotional responses may be rewarding or punishing
-- a might operate subconsciously

![Jeremy Bentham](/images/happiness/bentham.png)

We've already seen how intensity and duration are important (as intensity x duration = total hedonic sum). And the greeks already discussed the certainty/uncertainty, and the distance somewhat. What they didn't really mention was the repeatability and whether it was followed by pain which are two interesting criteria to introduce.

> Humans don´t live in territories but in habits. — Peter Sloterdijk

Repeatability is interesting because doing a small thing enough times can compound to have large effects. So even if there are a few events which result in the largest pleasure gains and pain removals, perhaps there are activities that we can do repeatedly which can improve our lives in small ways which add up to a large total over time. This is a smart view to take when you consider that **our lives are a sum of the small activities that we do repeatedly** - whether that be sleep, eat, socialise, work, play, our thoughts, the environment we are in, or our daily habits. I'll label all of these recurring experiences as "habits", as they are repeated emotional responses.

What this additional criteria suggests is that one way to improve your happiness is to find ways in which you can make repeatable small gains in pleasure and the removal of pain, which add up over time. I think why a lot of happiness stories get this premise wrong is because humans have a tendency to think globally in the timespan of a whole life and spotlight large events, rather think linearly and acknowledge that life is a secession of discrete events. This reminds me of an interesting point brought up in the movie [Before Sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Sunset) where the main actor mentionns how crazy it is that we are **living** our life right now.

> “Tomorrow will be like today. Life wastes itself whilst we are preparing to live.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Another interesting point which is obvious to most people, is whether or not the pleasure will be followed by pain, or vice versa. Bentham referred to this as *Purity*. Most of us have an intuitive grasp on purity of experience and is one of the biggest objections we have against decadent hedonism - because we infer that gorging ourselves with physical pleasures or hard drugs is followed by pains, therefore lacking purity.

![a](/images/happiness/purity.jpg)

This acknowledges an important fact about the pain and pleasure response: it isn't a sinewave or binary, it's a function. The value of the experience changes over time depending on what it is and the inputs. This gives us an interesting metric by which to judge various pleasures and pains - by averaging them out over time.

For example, if you take out a loan to go travelling, you might experience a chunk of pleasure upfront but you will suffer for it afterwards. Another very basic example is the sexual response cycle which is quite standard: an intensity of arousal/pleasure build from baseline to high, and then peaks at a climax before dropping back down to near neutral or just below.

![Climax](/images/happiness/climax.png)










<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being_contributing_factors
The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions suggests positive emotions (e.g. happiness, interest, anticipation)[76] broaden one's awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions. Over time, this broadened behavioral repertoire builds skills and resources. For example, curiosity about a landscape becomes valuable navigational knowledge; pleasant interactions with a stranger become a supportive friendship; aimless physical play becomes exercise and physical excellence. Positive emotions are contrasted with negative emotions, which prompt narrow survival-oriented behaviors. For example, the negative emotion of anxiety leads to the specific fight-or-flight response for immediate survival.[76] -->
