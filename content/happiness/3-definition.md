# What is Happiness (Theoretically)?
You can see how through unfolding what the basic principles of these three Greek schools are, we can extract out some common patterns for categorizing methods of improving happiness. The first theme is that there are physical pains and pleasures, and there are mental pains and pleasures. The other theme is that you can aim to maximize or minimize these various states. This leads us to a basic 4 by 4 matrix of possible ways to improve our happiness, or a 2 by 2 if we combine the physical and mental for the sake of simplicity:
1. Minimising Pleasures
2. Maximising Pains
3. Minimising Pains
4. Maximising Pleasures

But before we fully take the assumption for granted that pleasures are good, and pains are bad, and we should be maximizing and minimizing them, let's explore that.

The question of how to be "happy" or live a happy life has been a question plaguing humans since time immemorial.

Interestingly, even the most simple of organisms, the *Amoeba*, seems to display a "pain-like" and "pleasure-like" response, moving closer and feeding off of nearby foods and light, and avoiding noxious chemicals and other objects ([4](https://www.britannica.com/science/nervous-system)). All that and the amoeba is believed to be related to the earliest forms of life 800 million years ago! So the motivation of organisms to be pleasure seekers and pain avoiders it not a new phenomena.

Throughout most of animal history, animals would use their immediate environment as a guide to their behavior - they would live their life completely immersed in each moment, responding to threats of danger and seeking food to keep themselves alive long enough to spread their genes.

But at an unbeknown point, early humans developed enough sentience to begin asking *how they could be better* and *what they should do with the finite amount of time they're endowed*?

When you look at how people today actually behave, the rewards they seek and punishments they avoid are not based on some complex forms of reasoning and analysis like here, but are usually based on mere emotional response shortly preceding each behavior in time - which is predicted by [learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning). That is - people have conditioned responses to increase or decrease certain behaviors which have been previously associated with rewards or punishments.

Although it seems like human experience is infinitely diverse, due to the basic universal biology and evolution we all share, there is a finite list of less than 50 *types* of pleasure or pain episodes/experiences that we can all have. Anything we can think of as pleasurable or painful can be captured under this list. If you can find any others [let me know](https://adamdemirel.com):

## The Purpose of Pleasure
When you look over this list, you can see how most if not all serve an evolutionary purpose, even if not immediately evident. I'm not going to explain them all, but just a handful to highlight. The biological needs are obviously important as they **reward** us for returning to homeostasis. Physiological pleasures are either a hack we have found into a brain chemistry, or endogenous (produced by us) to offset pain. Learning of various sorts is how we acquired solutions to potential survival and reproduction problems by observing what others have done. Love is an emotion that bonds us so that we invest resources in offspring. Social pleasures are complex which form group cohesion so we can take care of eachother and have better odds. Cuteness is experienced so we care for the baby/animal/thing. We are attraacted to novelty and change because of the potential for new rewards in the environment.

This gives us an interesting model to think about pleasures, which makes sense. We evolved to experienced pleasure because it serves an evolutionary function: to motivate and reward us for experiences that increase our odds at survival and reproduction. The same fundamental motivation for nearly everything else. In fact, a norwegian biologist Bjørn Grinde wrote a whole book about trying to use evolution as a guide for living, called [Darwinian Happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinian_Happiness).



<!-- ### purpose of thoughts
- memory -> then emotional response
- affective forecast /prediction / visualisation -> emotional response
in comparison to environmental triggers/cues -> self talk -> emotional response

emotional response -> behavioral response (or extinguishment of) -> feedback loop into A
-- this whole model has a biological substrate,
-- emotional responses may be rewarding or punishing
-- a might operate subconsciously

![Jeremy Bentham](/images/happiness/bentham.png)

We've already seen how intensity and duration are important (as intensity x duration = total hedonic sum). And the greeks already discussed the certainty/uncertainty, and the distance somewhat. What they didn't really mention was the repeatability and whether it was followed by pain which are two interesting criteria to introduce.

> Humans don´t live in territories but in habits. — Peter Sloterdijk

Repeatability is interesting because doing a small thing enough times can compound to have large effects. So even if there are a few events which result in the largest pleasure gains and pain removals, perhaps there are activities that we can do repeatedly which can improve our lives in small ways which add up to a large total over time. This is a smart view to take when you consider that **our lives are a sum of the small activities that we do repeatedly** - whether that be sleep, eat, socialise, work, play, our thoughts, the environment we are in, or our daily habits. I'll label all of these recurring experiences as "habits", as they are repeated emotional responses.

What this additional criteria suggests is that one way to improve your happiness is to find ways in which you can make repeatable small gains in pleasure and the removal of pain, which add up over time. I think why a lot of happiness stories get this premise wrong is because humans have a tendency to think globally in the timespan of a whole life and spotlight large events, rather think linearly and acknowledge that life is a secession of discrete events. This reminds me of an interesting point brought up in the movie [Before Sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Sunset) where the main actor mentionns how crazy it is that we are **living** our life right now.

> “Tomorrow will be like today. Life wastes itself whilst we are preparing to live.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Another interesting point which is obvious to most people, is whether or not the pleasure will be followed by pain, or vice versa. Bentham referred to this as *Purity*. Most of us have an intuitive grasp on purity of experience and is one of the biggest objections we have against decadent hedonism - because we infer that gorging ourselves with physical pleasures or hard drugs is followed by pains, therefore lacking purity.

![a](/images/happiness/purity.jpg)

This acknowledges an important fact about the pain and pleasure response: it isn't a sinewave or binary, it's a function. The value of the experience changes over time depending on what it is and the inputs. This gives us an interesting metric by which to judge various pleasures and pains - by averaging them out over time.

For example, if you take out a loan to go travelling, you might experience a chunk of pleasure upfront but you will suffer for it afterwards. Another very basic example is the sexual response cycle which is quite standard: an intensity of arousal/pleasure build from baseline to high, and then peaks at a climax before dropping back down to near neutral or just below.

![Climax](/images/happiness/climax.png)

In summary of everything above, we've concluded that **a happy life can be evaluated by how much pleasure and pain it contains, due to them being the only intrinsic values. The more pleasure and the less pain, the better the life. Those pleasures/pains can be physical or psychological. And pleasures/pains differ in their intensity, duration, certainty, repeatability, and purity.** This means that to model how to improve happiness, we need to know how best to maximise pleasure and minimise pain.


There is a left-wing fifth but I will save it for last.














<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being_contributing_factors
The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions suggests positive emotions (e.g. happiness, interest, anticipation)[76] broaden one's awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions. Over time, this broadened behavioral repertoire builds skills and resources. For example, curiosity about a landscape becomes valuable navigational knowledge; pleasant interactions with a stranger become a supportive friendship; aimless physical play becomes exercise and physical excellence. Positive emotions are contrasted with negative emotions, which prompt narrow survival-oriented behaviors. For example, the negative emotion of anxiety leads to the specific fight-or-flight response for immediate survival.[76] -->
