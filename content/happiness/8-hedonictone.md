“- CONSIDER rewriting my ethical theory in terms of motivation being neuropsychological and life goals as maximising dopamine output // and how the traditional attitudinal/sensory distinction was just mindless intellectual posturing and arbitrary categories.”

I'd like to title this theory neurohedonism, and as it stands, I dont think the word has ever been used.
- I've concluded that all of the theoretical distinction collapses between attitudinal and sensory hedonism are irrelevant to the central dogma of hedonism which modern biology is naturally suggesting but nobody has seemed (as far as I know) to have explicitly stated in hedonistic theory – that pleasure, whether sensory or attitudinal, is good, and it is the **expression of particular neurotransmitter activity.**

- Thus, pleasure is the **expression of particular neurotransmitters and pain is the expression of others.**

- From my current understanding, the pleasure neurotransmitters which should be sought to be maximised are Dopamine, Serotonin, Norepinephrine, opoids, and maybe dynorphin, epinephrine
- From my current understanding, the pain neurotransmitters are Substance P (related to pain signalling, mentally and physically), and glucocticoids (cortisol in humans which is the stress response).
- The normative question then becomes how to maximise some neurotransmitters and reduce others? This is where I think modern science finally usurps philosophy in ethics as it has in all the other fields
- With a proposition such as “the more of certain transmitters, the better/more good/higher the value of the experience” one can easily see how quantifiable/falsifiable replies to objections of locke and bentham can be produced.
- I feel as if this could be extremely influential in political policies
- Another reformulation would be “the more of particular neurotransmitters the life contains, the better the life”
- So for objections like at the end of Feldman “the repugnant response” or whatever that a life containing a lot of small pleasures and nothing else is adverise, perhaps its because its speaking in abstract language like the rest of hedonistic theory has and missed that perhaps having small static levels of particular positive neurotransmitters like dopamine doesnt offset dysthemia or small persistent static levels of negative ones which produce boredom or pain

* There is a handful of Neurotransmitters which are implicated in well-being:
- Only Dopamine, Serotonin, and Norepinephrine out of the ~100 neurotransmitters seem to be implicated in depression. Epinephrine is also implicated in wakefulness. And Glucocorticoids in modulating the stress response.
* The value/happiness of one's life is determined by the balance of the relevant neurotransmitters.
* Keep in mind the human brain is plastic and is changing every second. Fire together wire together.


* The main factors that contribute to the balance of the relevant neurotransmitters are:
– Whether or not you have the **depression gene** ((1) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12161658 (Technically, The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the promotor region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), not the gene itself. (1b) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12869766  – This paper showed that individuals who carried a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) were more vulnerable to developing depression following exposure to stressful life events.. (1c) http://brainworldmagazine.com/the-new-new-genetics-gets-practical/) Stressful life events were measured as employment, financial, housing, health, and relationship stressors.), in conjunction with **stressful early life** events which increases likelihood of depression (Gene x Environment interaction). This explains why stressful events lead to depression in some people but not in others.

- Massages increase dopamine and serotonin, and decrease cortisol (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162447)
– Coffee increases Serotonin transmission, but you build up a tolerance and may have withdrawals without it.
- Take fish oil daily, as deficiency in omega 3 can result in mood disorders (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16741195)
- The ability to delay gratification is the #1 predictor of future success (?). Interestingly, the ability to delay gratification is mediated by serotonin levels (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18434531).
- Taking antidepressant drugs (SSRI, SNDRI etc.) to off-set the negative brain chemistry consequences (depression) of stressful early life events
- Not depleting one's reward system through excessive porn or masturbation (http://www.yourbrainonporn.com/adolescent-brain-meets-highspeed-internet-porn)
- Engaging in regular exercise (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise#Depression)
