### Remembered Utility - Life Satisfaction (LS)
By asking people to rate their satisfaction with their life on a scale of 1-10, a lot of findings have been made in the field of happiness research.
The findings of these studies are quite interesting, and many commonsense notions about happiness appear to be inaccurate.

Here is a list of things that do and don't correlate with Life Satisfaction:

#### Variables That Strongly Predict LS

* **Genetics** ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16219116), [ref](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20150926115101/http://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/research/wellbeing/causes_and_effects_of_wellbeing.asp)) unfortunately account for about 30-40% of variance of LS ([ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0307-6)), which is a *lot* - more than anything else. How? By shaping one's personality and temperament, which are known to be heritable. The best predictor of individuals future happiness is their past happiness. Some people seem destined to be happy and others unhappy, regardless of their triumphs or setbacks. The limited influence of life events is demonstrated with the hedonic treadmill (which I'll talk about further below).
* **Personality** ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-11667-032), [ref](http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/3_happiness/Steel2008_5FM_and_happiness_psych_bull.pdf), [ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23075216)) - with the largest effect being due to **extroversion**, with agreeableness, conscientiousness, self-esteem, and optimism also being strongly related. ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00541-009)) **An Optimistic mindset** in explaining negative setbacks is also important ([ref](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26123.Learned_Optimism)) - ie ones beliefs about themselves, others, and the world, and the absence of cognitive distortions/learned helplessness.
* **Mental Health** is the one of strongest individual predictors of LS ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5511887/))
* **Love and marriage** ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-019), [ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022100031004001)). People consistently rate being in love as one of the most critical ingredients of happiness. Married people have higher LS than the single or divorced. However the relationship is unclear whether LS causes marital satisfaction, or marital satisfaction causes LS.
* **The Fulfillment of Basic Needs / Not Being in Poverty** ([ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0307-6), [ref](https://adamdemirel.com/job-satisfaction/#section-50), [ref](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021381616824), [ref](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/williamtov/pubs/2009_DienerKahnemanEtAl.pdf)) - Basic needs include food and shelter. LS rises steeply from dire poverty to an income of ~20k per year (depending on the country), and then a slow trend upwards to ~50k/yr.
* **[Job satisfaction](https://adamdemirel.com/job-satisfaction)** ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00541-019)). People often complain about their work, so you wouldn't expect it to be a key source of LS, but it is. It's not as critical as love or marriage, but Job Satisfaction has a substantial association with LS. Studies also show that **unemployment** has strong negative effects on SWB ([ref](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225510/subjective_wellbeing_employment.pdf)). Again, it's difficult to sort out whether job satisfaction causes happiness or vice versa, but evidence suggests that causation flows both ways.
* **[Sleep Quality](https://adamdemirel.com/sleep)** ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/live-well-for-less/living-well-index))
* **Being Sick or Disabled** highly correlates with low LS.
* **Debt** ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16649863), [ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167487005000103))

![variables](/images/happiness/variables.jpg)

#### Variables That Moderately Predict LS
* **Self Reported Health** (~.32) ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-018), [ref](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533006776526030)). Good health status by itself is only moderately correlated with LS, as many people tend to take good health for granted. Being sick on the other hand has a larger effect.
* **Social Activity / Sociability** ([ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00501001.x)). Humans are social animals, as as such interpersonal relations do appear to contribute to LS. Those who are socially active and are satisfied with their social support and friendship networks report above average levels of LS. Also, people who had deep and substantive conversations have higher LS than those who mostly engage in small talk ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2861779/)).
* **Health & Happiness Of Close Relatives** ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/live-well-for-less/living-well-index)) ([ref](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533006776526030))
* **Religion** ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-019)), though this may be due to religious attendance and not religious belief ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19142047))
* **Mindfulness** ([ref](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2003_BrownRyan.pdf))
* **Participating in a Sport** ([ref](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487012000402))
* **Whether You Eat Alone Often** ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/~/media/Files/S/Sainsburys/living-well-index/Sainsburys%20Living%20Well%20Index%20Wave%204%20Jun%202019%20FV.pdf))
* **Sex life** ([ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/live-well-for-less/living-well-index))
* **Frequent Verbal Expressions of Positive Emotions** ([ref](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533006776526030))
* **Internet users** are more satisfied with their lives than non internet users ([ref](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297721767_Life_Satisfaction_Of_The_Internet_And_Non-Internet_Users_In_Thailand))
* **Chronotype**: Morning Larks have higher LS than Night Owls ([ref](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07420528.2012.685671), [ref](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07420528.2013.840786))
* **Being able to regulate negative emotions** ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-011-9312-4))
* **Height** ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693261))
* **Appreciation** which includes being present, self/social comaparison, gratitude, and interpersonal appreciation ([ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886912000888))
* **Living With Your Partner** rather than alone ([ref](https://aifs.gov.au/publications/life-satisfaction-across-life-course-transitions), [ref](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/~/media/Files/S/Sainsburys/living-well-index/Sainsburys%20Living%20Well%20Index%20Wave%204%20Jun%202019%20FV.pdf))

#### Variables That Weakly Predict LS
* **Leisure Satisfaction**: Being satisfied with how you spend your leisure time ([ref](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/11745398.2010.9686871))
* **Income**: There is a positive correlation, but it's weak: but its weak (between .12 and .20) ([ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00501001.x), [ref](https://adamdemirel.com/job-satisfaction/#section-50)). Though it's high between poverty and low LS as we saw.
* **Video game** use in young people improves LS slightly ([ref](https://mindfulnessinschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/video-games-and-wellbeing.pdf))
* **Home Ownership** ([ref](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24719087)). It's more important for females than males. However its effect on LS seems to depend on *income level* - with home ownership being less important for lower income groups, potentially due to 'aspiration preferences' ([ref](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254420231_Homeownership_and_subjective_well-being)). Some seemingly better research suggests that homeownership improves *housing satisfaction* but not LS ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11205-010-9607-6)) and that they might actually not be happier at all due to spending their time in worse ways ([ref](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1877163)). Also having a **home loan** has a negative effect on LS ([ref](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24719087)).
* **The Absence of Smoking Cigarettes** - quitting smoking improves LS ([ref](https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/26/2/195.abstract))
* **Donating to Charity** ([ref](https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/#if-you-gave-money-to-charity-would-it-make-you-more-satisfied-or-less), [ref](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/giving-and-happiness/))
* **Your Country** weakly predicts your LS (<.10) - ranging from 6.5 (for Brazil) to 7.5/10 (for Finland) ([ref](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/)).
* **Working 4 days > 5** days increases life satisfaction by 5% ([ref](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/work-less-get-more-new-zealand-firms-four-day-week-an-unmitigated-success), [ref](https://www.fwc.gov.au/resources/research/australian-workplace-relations-study/first-findings-report/6-employee-experiences/job-satisfaction-employees))
* The personality trait **Zest** due to living in the present ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zest_(positive_psychology)#Life_satisfaction_and_Zest))
* **Healthy eating** ([ref](http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&context=econ_workingpapers), [ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019566631630931X), [ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-019-09748-7))
* **Yoga** ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10846636))

![a](/images/happiness/swbbycountry.png)

#### Variables Unrelated to LS
* **Physical Attractiveness** ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1995-40426-001))
* **Intelligence** ([ref](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2143374))
* **Gender** ([ref](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327582ijpr0403_7?journalCode=hjpr20))
* **Age** is completely related according to some research (<1% variance) ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-03362-000), [ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691618765171)), whereas others demonstrate a U curve, meaning a drop in happiness mid life before a raise in late life ([ref](https://aifs.gov.au/publications/life-satisfaction-across-life-course-transitions))
* **Parenthood** ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-00473-000), [ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-00473-000)). Compared to childless couples, parents worry more and experience more marital problems. But parents seem to have around the same LS as the childless. Other research shows a sharp drop in LS post birth ([ref](https://aifs.gov.au/publications/life-satisfaction-across-life-course-transitions)).

As you can see, quite a number of factors that you might expect to be influential appear to bear little or no relationship to general happiness. And you can find study correlations between all sorts of things ([ref](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/33KewgYhNSxFpbpXg/scientific-self-help-the-state-of-our-knowledge), [ref](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4su/how_to_be_happy/)) - [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction) did a great writeup. The list of factors that turn out to have fairly strong associations with happiness is surprisingly short. The key ingredients of high LS appear to involve having basic needs met, health, love, work, and genetic predisposition expressed through personality.

In summary, the main findings of the LS research has been highlighted by [Ed Diener](https://eddiener.com/articles#2019) (the pioneer) in these 3 reviews: [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0307-6), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6329388/#S7title), and [here](https://eddiener.com/articles/925). His main findings are that life satisfaction reports tend to be stable over time. Genetics account for 30-40% of the variance in happiness ratings, caused by having a happy/unhappy personality - specifically extraversion being good, and neuroticism being bad. The cause of genes and personality on wellbeing are perhaps the only major long term causes. But 60-70% is also environmental and within our control. Those environmental variables are fulfilling our basic needs (food and shelter), psychological needs (eg autonomy), social needs, and experiencing respect from others. Income is important up until a point, because it helps us fulfill our basic needs.

With this knowledge, we are now more equipped to answer the question of which pleasure episodes are large.

### Hedonic Adaptation
Unfortunately there is not any perfect research measuring the curve or experience of all the different pleasures we laid out, but the LS research has given us data on which life events have the biggest effects.

What the data shows is that people tend to get a substantial **drop** in LS after unemployment, while approaching widowhood, after marriage, after the birth of a child ([ref](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#life-satisfaction-through-life-events)), at the ending of a relationship, or the death of a loved one or parent ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289759/)).

And people tend to get a substantial **boost** in LS after divorce, layoff, starting a new relationship, gaining employment, starting pregnancy, starting a new educational course, and buying a new house ([ref](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#life-satisfaction-through-life-events), [ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17905809).

![a](/images/happiness/lifeevents.png)

So these changes in life circumstances have the potentially largest gains and losses on our well-being, but as the chart above demonstrates, for most life events, people quickly return back to a baseline of LS. For example, people report higher LS for around 2 years after marriage before returning to baseline. A lot of us have heard of the two most popular examples of this adaptation: the first is where a lottery winner (experiencing a large positive event) and a quadriplegic (experiencing a large negative event) both have the same level of happiness after a few years. Unfortunately or fortunately, this returning to baseline happens to basically all life events, except a couple of exceptions like *(imprisonment? etc? from which paper?)*. Nearly all major life events are return back to baseline by the 5th year mark.

This returning back to baseline of LS is what's known as Hedonic Adaptation, or **[Hedonic Treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)**, and the the odd fact that people return back to different levels of baseline is what's called **Set Point Theory**, which is believed to be biologically determined, and which we will come back to later.

It's referred to as a treadmill, because just like on a treadmill you return to the same spot, so too do you return to the same level of happiness. This happens for both LS and the more everyday experience of pleasure and pain which we are all aware of. This is one of the sad facts about human experience and pleasure: the first bite of a meal is great, the last bite not so much. Or in more general terms, the more we do of something pleasurable, the less enjoyable it becomes. Most of us have experienced this personally in the form of dreaming for something: a product or experience, and once attaining it moving on with life. We usually refer to this adaptation to experienced utility as **diminishing returns**, and it's what Economists more precisely call [Diminishing Marginal Utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Diminishing_marginal_utility).

![diminishing returns](/images/happiness/diminishing.jpg)

Though remember that this doesn't make pleasure *completely* valueless, as you are still experiencing pleasure or LS prior to returning to baseline.

The reason that we adapt to pleasurable sensations as well as LS is likely due to the same reason that we adapt to all other sensory phenomena - because we adapt to irrelevant information. It's known that what makes its way into human perception is heavily weighted on changes in the environment. For example, an abrupt change in sound relative to the baseline will be perceived, as well as visual movement, tactile sensations, and new smells, etc. The reason is because changes in the environment most require our attention and are potentially risky or rewarding.

This makes evolutionary sense as remember that pleasures are rewards for attaining a need, and obviously we cannot be in a constant state of bliss because (a) the need gets satisfied quickly, and (b) if we were constantly experiencing pleasure we wouldn't seek out our needs. This is also similar to what the philosopher [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer) in regards to critiquing Utopian societies.

This is also likely the reason that our evaluative responses to LS are weighted in *changes* to our circumstabnces - but which we also adapt to to ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6329388/#S23title)). For example, our LS undergoes sudden drops or gains soon after big life events - and our evaluation of our life changes briefly, but then it returns back to baseline. This has led some to believe that although our LS reports are adapting, perhaps the circumstances themselves are still 'objectively' better or worse, but it is our aspirations that have adapted.

Other research calls this return to baseline the Hedonic Adaptation Prevention Model, which leads us into looking at any ways that it can be prevented. The psychologist [Sonja Lyubomirsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonja_Lyubomirsky) is the leading researcher in this area and covered a lot of it in her book [The How of Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2326098.The_How_of_Happiness). One of the main ideas is that we can prevent adapting to positive experiences by (1) continuing to savor them, and (2) having continued variety of experiences ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22361725)). Novelty is one of the pleasure events that we mentioned in our list, and it turns out one of the reasons it is so great is that it is the solution to adaptation.

A third solution can be found in the great book with a bad name [Happy Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15803098-happy-money), which is simply to partake in the pleasurable experiences less frequently - this is another mode for preventing adaptation.

#### Issues with SWB / Remembered Utility
Bringing all of the above life satisfaction research into perspective, remember that this is one method that we use in researching happiness, and what this method relies upon is an individual trying to summarize an experience after the fact, into a single rating. This is equivalent to us having a memory (of an experience), which is then followed by an emotional response. And then we base our evaluation of that whole experience based on that emotional response.

You would think this would be extremely erroneous for many reasons, which have led many to doubt the validity of LS and remembered utility. For instance, researchers have manipulated the context and mood of the subjects in many ways to see if it influences their reports - from priming their environment ([ref](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=870494)), to the weather, to being influenced by the order of the survey questions, to making them feel good beforehand by example finding a coin before filling out the survey ([ref](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533006776526030)), and there is also room for the subject to interpret the meaning of the question differently. But it was found that although LS reports are influenced by current mood, it's not a large effect ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936533)).

But it turns out that given the large sample size of these studies, these anomalies basically balance themselves out. One promising finding of LS reports are that they are relatively stable across time - they correlate at 0.77 when measured again after 4 weeks which isn't as high as some other measures in psychology but is still quite stable and reassuring ([ref](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533006776526030)). And although current mood and context may fluctuate day to day which may alter individual reports, it might be reliable enough for many purposes ([ref](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533006776526030)). So there are reasons to be skeptical of the complete reliability of the reports, but they are not grounds for dismissing it *completely*, yet. Though they do fall short as a measure of real-time experiences.

Diener has said that the reason they continue to study life satisfaction reports in face of these anomalies is the idea that "how each person thinks and feels about his or her life is important" ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-16279-000)). Indeed, life satisfaction reports tend to correlate around .7 with reports of experienced emotions over time ([ref](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-00334-001)) - at least in this short 3 week study.

But intuitively, there does seem to be some obvious deficits with measuring happiness like this ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6329388/)). And there is one big reason, and that big reason it is inaccurate is because it is a cognitive rather than an emotional account - meaning participants reflect and then rate, there is no reason to believe it's very accurate or that humans are able to do this well.

If you ask somebody to rate their life on a scale of 1-10, this is a single retrospective judgement at one moment in time and it is impossible that participants are able to accurately remember every single emotion they have ever experienced, and sum them up in their head, do a calculation on them, and output an accurate reflection of their life. It is infeasible that we are able to conduct a comprehensive search of the relevant memories and aggregate them into a meaningful report ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6329388/)) - in fact the research shows that people make judgements too quickly for it to even be feasible that they are searching their memory at all ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12405138)) - people make the judgments almost instantly.

So what are they doing then? It's been suggested that perhaps people are recalling a LS judgment stored in their memory, or they are using quick heuristics that enable fast but still potentially accurate reports (([unlikely](http://www.economics-ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2012-28/references/Schwarz1999)), or their current mood was influencing their LS judgment. Research demonstrates the latter does happen as mentioned, but unfortunately the sample sizes of the current studies demonstrating this are quite small, even if it seems likely. So although the current research shows the effect sizes of the latter are small ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:SOCI.0000003801.89195.bc)), these are small and imperfect studies.


The best argument I've found for what LS reports are doing is the following ([ref](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951240)). As we've established, pleasure and pain are approach/avoid signals. This makes a lot of sense in the context of experienced utility where our behavior is being changed in real-time by those signals. The core purpose of pleasure and pain is regulate our response to the current situation, immediately. But LS and remembered utility are different - they are not experienced real-time, they are retrospective. But like experienced utilities, remembered utilities share an evolutionary function: they determine whether an episode in the past should now be approached or avoided. So remembered utilities are also controlling our current and future behavior, but it is based on events from the past, rather than the present. Our brain is summarizing an episode of experience, with all of its pleasure and pain, and outputting a single rating which reflects whether *overall* it was something good which we should approach in the future, or avoid. This is what all of our evaluations of the past are doing. And our LS reports are very likely just an odd new construction that takes advantage of the human ability to do this cognitive evaluation of the past, with the researchers thinking that it was accurately doing so.

But besides the reasons mentioned earlier about the unlikelihood of it being accurate, there are real demonstrations which highlight the errors of remembered utility.

To demonstrate, it is first necessary to introduce you to the term *instant utility* which will be elaborated on more in the the section on **experienced utility**. Remember that in Remembered Utility, individuals try to summarize their series of positive and negative emotions over a time period? And as mentioned, Economists refer to these waning of pleasures and pains as utils. Well the term employed to represent the base unit of a 3 second "present" is Instant Utility - that is, the current experience of pleasure or pain at its most basic unit, which is immediately reported when asked how one is feeling in the moment. It is the bare unit of measurement of experience with the most accuracy.

Measuring these Instant Utilities over a time period and summing them up result in Experienced Utility - that is, many instant utilities that have been reported in real-time. An instant utility is singular. And so the way to measure whether Remembered Utility is accurate is by measuring Experienced Utility and comparing it with Remembered Utility to determine whether our evaluations of the past accurately reflect what we feel while that experience was happening - which is the closest source of truth about that experience.

Many studies have done this ([ref](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951240)). One way that instant utility is measured is by giving subjects a handle that they can move up or down which indicates their experience from "very unpleasant" to "very pleasant" in real-time.

The first noteworthy example is a study where subjects were given 16 short plotless videos, with half being pleasant (eg nature scenes), and the other half aversive (eg surgeries). There were two versions of each film: a 1 minute short version and a 2 minute longer version, with the same content. Each subject watched the short and long versions of 8 of the videos while controlling the sliding knob, to indicate their instant utility or disutility. Afterwards the subjects were asked "Overall how much pleasure or displeasure/discomfort did you experience during the film?" to measure remembered utility.

What the result of this among others demonstrated is the following: That the subjects based their remembered utilities on the instant utilities at the Peak (the most intense value) and the instant utilities at the End of the video - what's come to be known as the [Peak-End Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule) in psychology that affects most evaluations. An implication of this is that the subjects completely neglected the duration of the experience or sum of Instant Utilities in making their Remembered Utility evaluations (remembered "duration-neglect"?). The third is that when asked to make a choice about which future decisions to repeat - individuals generally choose the experiences from the past with the highest Remembered Utility, not Experienced Utility (which we will come back to). This supports our argument from above that Remembered Utilities have an evolutionary function - to guide our future actions. And it seems to be doing that on the assumption that the Peak-End Rule is a valid way of assessing experiences.

What this demonstrates is that Life Satisfaction measures which depend on Remembered Utility evaluations cannot be completely relied upon. In fact, Psychologists recognize this and is why Subjective Wellbeing research is split into Life Satisfaction and "Affective Balance" measures which aim to measure Experienced Utility (next section). Although these cognitive evaluations are doing something - informing our future decisions, it's discrepancy with Experience Utility leads us to think that humans did not evolve to be happy, but to survive.

As a final demonstration of the above oddity, there are a lot of experiments that demonstrate something similar to the following ([ref](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951240)). If you get subjects to hold their hand in cold 14C water for 60 seconds, experiencing substantial pain, and also later a longer 90 seconds, with the first 60 seconds being the same 14C water with pain, but with the final 30 seconds the temperature is slowly reduced to a less painful 15C, subjects remembered the longer period as less aversive (due to it ending on a less negative note). And as a result they will choose to repeat this experience over the shorter again if given the choice.

This is terrible that an extra period of discomfort at the end can reduce the peak end average and make the remembered utility less bad, when the longer episode is experientially worse. What this demonstrates is that people are willing to endure more painful experiences if they remember them to be less painful. This is obviously not conducive to experienced happiness, which is what I'll cover next.
