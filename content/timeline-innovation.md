A timline of tech innovation

Stone Tool Development:

> Pre-Mode I (3.3M BC): Cut and grooved animal bones with found stones.


> Mode I / Oldowan (2.6M BC): Used a hammerstone (uncut rock) to hit another and break the edge off, creating *one* sharp edge/tip.
>> The 'chopper' (larger) used for cutting wood, meat, and hide.
>> The 'scraper' (smaller) used for removing hair and shaping wood.

> Mode II / Acheulean (1.7M BC):  Precise manufacturing of a rock to create a biface - two convex faces intersecting at a sharp edge. Used for slicing and as a hand axe.

> Mode III / Mousterian (160,000 BC): Small flakes are struck off large cores and then retouched. Produced smaller knife-like tools.

> Mode IV / Aurignacian (50,000 BC): Creation and use of long blades. Increases the efficiency of core usage over flakes (more blades per core).

> Mode V (35,000 BC): Production of microliths began - small hard point, often mounted on a shaft as a spear.

> Neolithic (10,000 BC): Polished stoned tools to implement axes that are harder and move through wood easier.

11th century AD - The first documented record of gunpowder and the fire arrow, an early form of rocketry, appears in the Chinese text Wujing Zongyao.

Tech evolution theory 1 (Leslie White) -- Harnessing and Controlling energy:
Stage 1. We use our muscles for energy.
2. Then domesticated animals.
3. Use the energy of Plants (agricultural revolution)
4. Learn to use Natural resources (coal, oil, gas)
5. We harness Nuclear Energy

Tech evolution theory 2 (Gerhard Lenski) -- Amassing information.
Stage 1. Information is passed by genes.
2. Gain sentience and pass information through experience.
3. Start using signs and develop logic.
4. Create symbols, develop language, and writing.
me: 5. Images/Videos?
me: 6. Communication over far distances with telephone, and then the internet?
me: 7. Communication in VR? (6 with higher resolution)
me: 8. @elonmusk's neuralink?
What else?

Tech evolution theory 3 -- Food cultivation.
Stage 1. Hunt and gather food.
2. Cultivate food/animals in 1 location (agricultural rev)
3. Allow others to cultivate food for us (industrial rev)
4. Food freely available in supermarkets
5. Food delivery (ubereats, foodoroo)

Tech evolution theory 4 -- Units of Exchange.
Stage 1. Goods are the only unit of value.
2. Services overlay goods.
3. Goods are plentiful and information is more valuable.
4. Attention is the most valuable commodity.
5.

"in 1949 after a pleasant evening  at a new york city restaurant , frank mcnamara  discovered he didnt have any cash. he soon created the diners club card , ensuring that hed never have to experience that mortificataion again.  apparently others shared his desire to avoid such mishap. adoption of this proto-credit card soon followed by american express, master card, and countless other pieces of plastic that clutter the modern wallet. https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/history-of-credit-cards.php
