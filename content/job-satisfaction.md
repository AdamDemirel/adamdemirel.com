intro (make it enticing)
If you're like the majority of humans, you will have no option but to work to generate income to provide yourself with food and shelter. Sure, you do have other options like being voluntarily homeless, opting for a life of extreme frugality - eg in a van (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downshifting_(lifestyle)), living off of welfare or leeching from others, etc (?), but to most these are not seductive alternatives to simply abiding by the system which gives them a regular paycheck.

The average working week is 40 hours, so assuming you work for 40 hours a week, from ages 20-60 before you retire, the amount of total hours that you will work in your life is roughly 80,000 hours (50 weeks _ 40 years _ 40 hours). That's a lot of hours.

// Add some comments from finding flow about people spend their lives here.

Fortunately, you have a lot of control over how you will spend this time. And given the disproportionate amount of your life that you will spend there, succeeded only by time spent sleeping, it is only logical to spend some time thinking strategically about how you will spend it, otherwise you may just go with the flow and accept the status quo.

Not only do you spend a lot of time working, but how satisfaction you are with your job is also one of the strongest determinants of how satisfied with your life you are. These concepts in the research are both referred to as _job satisfaction_ and _life satisfaction_ measures. There is a significant correlation of 0.44 (sample size 20k, tait et all, 1989) between them. It is suggested that the relationship is reciprocal or bidirectional in cause - ie life satisfaction may positive influence job satisfaction, and job satisfaction can also positively influence life satisfaction.

Funnily enough, retirement or unemployment is not the answer. Unemployment turns out to make people very unhappy (Argyle (2001). The Psychology of Happiness (2nd ed.). New York: Routledge.). Other research ccccccorrobrates that satisfatrongly correlated with happiness. (Judge & Klinger 2008; Warr 1999)

According to Gallup, in 2013 around 70% of American workers are either "not engaged" or "actively disengaged" with their work (http://www.gallup.com/strategicconsulting/163007/state-american-workplace.aspx). Given what I've said above, obviously this is not an optimal way to spend ones existence. The purpose of money is to be a flat medium that allows you to exchange it for things that you want - or more basically, the purpose of money is to solve problems. If the generation of money creates more problems than it solves, then it is no longer serving its purpose.

Throughout this (article) I will be reviewing my research on which criteria/determinants/causes/aspects make up job satisfaction, and hopefully being aware of what the current research says will influence your choices in some way.

# Job Satisfaction

_Job satisfaction_ is a measurement taken in Psychology of an attitude that people have towards their job, measured in a variety of ways. It is linked to worker productivity and performance, motivation, workplace civility, prosociality, absenteeism, lateness, stress (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191308510000067), accidents, withdrawal intentions and employee turnover/retention, organisational commitment, mental and physical health, and most interestingly _life satisfaction_. The most widely built upon definition of job satisfaction is that it is

> “a pleasurable or positive emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one’s job or job experiences”.

There are three main ways to measure job satisfaction: evaluative, cognitive, and behavioural. Evaluative satisfaction is when the subject reports "I like/dislike my job". Cognitive satisfaction regards beliefs about the nature of subjects work - eg that their work is challenging/respectable/demanding/rewarding. And indirect behavioural measurements of job satisfaction are found via absenteeism, lateness, sickness.

There are five main schools of thought on what leads to job satisfaction:

1. Motivation Characteristics - That satisfying jobs contain specific attributes in and of themselves that make them satisfying.
2. Social Characteristics - That job satisfaction is derived from positive social interactions.
3. Environment Characteristics - There are factors in the workplace environment itself that are important.
4. Dispositional / Worker Characteristics - Job satisfaction is mediated by personality
5. Person-Environment Fit - The match between an individuals interests and preferences, and the job.

1-3 Have really good dateaan them which will look at to see how much they are related to job satisfaction. 4 and 5 both have some data but not quite as robust, and will also look at them. We will then look at a handful of other variables which also are less well supported than the first 3 but nonetheless are relevant - such as income.

I'm going to cover what the research on these has to say, and then explore a list of variables that I think are noteworthy, and hopefully we can discover which determinants/antecedents/predictors of job satisfaction, so that we can control them. Although the following may seem like a lot of information and correlational evidence, note that the main paper it is drawn from (humphrey 2007) originally found 6,333 unique correlations across 260 articles with a pooled sample size of X, and these were the most noteworthy.

Throughout the article I will be posting a number that correlates with the amount of job satisfaction, eg x correlates with job satisfaction by y amount. what this means is:

- How does this all relate to job satisfaction? Mention drunk driving example. So basically the more characteristics you have down, the more likely you are to have job satisfaction. And even if you have some factors under control, others still have the opportunity to control it.

The absolute best measure we have of Job Satisfaction as a whole is done via the "Overall Job Satisfaction Measure", a 5-item inventory that correlates extremely highly at 0.85 which is what you'd expect when it is directly asking you about JS:
  > 1. All things considered, are you satisfied with your present job (circle one)? YES NO
  > 2. How satisfied are you with your job in general (circle one)? 1 very dissatisfied; 2 somewhat dissatisfied; 3 neutral; 4 somewhat satisfied; 5 very satisfied.
  >    Below, please write down your best estimates on the percent of time you feel satisfied, dissatisfied, and neutral about your present job on average. The three figures should add up to equal 100%. ON THE AVERAGE:
  >    > 3. The percent of time I feel satisfied with my present job 30% (note: only this response is scored)
  >    > 4. The percent of time I feel dissatisfied with my present job 30%
  >    > 5. The percent of time I feel neutral about my present job 40%
  >    >    TOTAL %

# 1. Motivational Characteristics

Motivational characteristics encompass characteristics of the job which are related to the nature of the work itself, and a result, how that affects the worker. The original model is called the Job Characteristics Model and is the most widely studied, oldest, and strongly supported theory in job satisfaction.

“The most consistent predictor of job satisfaction is mentally challenging work (2) - derived via meetin te JCM” ( https://80000hours.org/2012/08/how-to-find-a-job-you-ll-love/ https://80000hours.org/2012/08/don-t-do-what-you-re-passionate-about-part-2/ ) ("http://www.timothy-judge.com/c06.pdf Judge, T. A., Klinger, R. (2009). “Promote Job Satisfaction through Mental Challenge”. Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behaviour, Second Ed, pp107-119)

There is widespread agreement that the job characteristics model below is the strongest predictor of what constitutes a satisfying job above and beyond all oter factors. Of all the variables correlated with job satisfaction, all 5 job characteristics correlated with job satisfaction at a high .41.

## Job Characteristics Model

The job characteristics research is one of most well researched approaches and identifies that it is the nature of the job itself, not anything else, that determines how satisfying the job is. The original and withstanding model was developed in 1975 by Hackman and Oldham and proposed five factors which make work satisfying for workers and that make up a satisfaction job:

1. Autonomy
2. Skill Variety
3. Task Identity
4. Task Significance
5. Feedback from the job

All of these factors together result in high work **engagement**. The more of them you have, the more satisfying the job, irrespective of who is doing the job, where it is, how much it pays, etc. You want a job that engages you because challenge gets you into flow. “the right job according to mihaly C is a job that challenges us to an optimal level - one thats neither so hard that we give up nor so easy that we get bored. finding a job that engages your natural talents and give you constant feedback is a sure way to build happiness.” [ https://signalvnoise.com/posts/104-all-about-flow #]

What's the most interesting about the job charactieristcs model is that noen of it is paticularly relted to the subject matter of the work, a failed bias we are typically drawn to. Instead, what the job is doesnt matter so much as what the factors it has are.

These were all originally measured by what is called the _Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS)_ (reference), a series of questions with a 1-7 scale. The survey that is used to test it is most recently called the Work Design Questionairre, and you can see the questions asked here https://msu.edu/~morgeson/English_WDQ.pdf.

// TODO
does your country determine the effects of job characteristics? https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969593115000062

### Autonomy

Autonomy is the freedom that an individual has in carrying out teir work, or the degree to which one has control over how to do a job. In the JDS, it was measured by asking

> How much autonomy is there in your job? That is, to what extent does your job permit you to decide _on your own_ how to go about doing the work?

It was later argued (Breaugh 1985, Morgeson and Humphrey 2006) that autonomy wasn't a singular construct like it was being measured oriinally, but was made up of multiple factors that each had their own predictive values. Most important being:

1. Work Scheduling Autonomy - The freedom to control the scheduling and timing of work (Jackson and colleagues same as below)
2. Work Methods Autonomy - The freedom to control which methods and procedures are utilized (jackson and colleagues 1993)
3. Decision Making Autonomy - The freedom to make decisions at work (Karasek et al 1998)

So roughly speaking, job autonomy is how much the job allows you to decide yourself _how and when to do your work_. A paper also calls it simply “absence of close supervision” (warr 1999);

### Skill Variety / Task Variety

Skill Variety is the extent to which an individual must use different skills to perform at his/her job. It is separate from Task Variety which is the extent to which an individual performs different tasks at the job. Task Identity wasn't originally measured by Hackman but was instead measured in a separate survey called the _Job Characteristics Inventory (SCI)_ in 1976 (sims, szilagyi, 1976).

Both constructs are very similar but have slightly different predictive power. Skill variety focuses on the skills of the worker, whereas the task variety focuses more on the job itself which is more consistent with the other 4 factors of the job characteristics model. As a result of their similarity, they have often been combined together and measured as one construct in popular studies.

Task Identity was measured by asking:

> How much _variety_ is there in your job? That is, to what extent does the job require you to do many different things at work, using a variety of skills and talents?

Skill Identity was measured by asking:

> How much variety is there in your job?
> How similar are the asks you perform in a typical work day?
> The opportunity to do a number of different things
> The amount of variety in my job

So roughly speaking, task and skill variety are together the extent to which a job allows an individual to _engage in different tasks utilizing different skills_. A paper also calls it simply _nonrepetitive work_ (warr 1999);

### Task Identity

Task Identity is about the extent to which the outcome of your work is connected to te work tat you do, or about te extent to wic an individual can complete a wole piece of work.

Task identity was meauured by askin:

> To what extent does your job involve doing a _"whole" and identifiable piece of work?_ That is, is the job a complete piece of work that has an obvious beginning and end? Or is it only a small _part_ of the overall piece of work, which is finished by other people or by automatic machines?

### Task Significance (TS) / Helping Others

Task significance (aka Contribution) is the extent to which your job impacts others lives, or how important you see your job tasks. It's related to how meaningful your work is, or more concretely, how directly and intensely it has an impact on other's wellbeing.

TS was measured in the JCS (jc survey) by asking:

> In general, how _significant or important_ is your job? That is, How much are the results of your work likely to significantly affect the lives or well-being of other people?

Grant, et al. (26) later re-evaluated task signifiance and measured it as:
> My job provides opportunities to substantially improve the welfare of other people
> My job enhances the welfare of others.

He then extended the 4 items by which to measure (26) to test task significance in the JCM, again on a 1-7 scale.

1. Job Dedication (the amount of time and effort expended in completing assigned tasks) and
2. Helping Behaviour (performance review by employer on pro-social behaviour)
3. Perceived social impact, and
> “I feel that I can have a positive impact on others through my work.”
4. Perceived social worth
> “I feel that others appreciate my work”

"Whereas task significance describes the extent to which a job provides opportunities to improve the welfare of others, perceived social impact describes the extent to which employees feel that their own actions improve the welfare of others."

1 and 2 are outcome measures and demonstrated a causal link btw task signifiance and JS/job performance. Noteworthy is that the JCM assumes task signifiance is a job characteristic, but (26)'s experiments demonstrat that it's a social characteristic instead. How much task signifiance affects job performance and JS is mediated by how much an individual subjectively evaluates their job for 3 and 4.

Work that helps others is also often linked to meaning, and vice versa. An extreme view which potentially captures the dissatisfaction that results from meaningless work is by Erich Fromm:

> I think his work is to a large extent meaningless. Because he his not related to it, he is increasingly part of a big social machinery governed by a big beauracracy, and I think american man subconsciously hates his work very often, because he feels trapped by it, imprisoned by it, because he feels as if he is spending most of his energy for something which has no meaning in itself. He's not dignified in making a life with his work because that's not quite enough to make one happy, if one spends 8 hours a day in something which in itself has no meaning and interest except that one gains money from it. The deeper meaning is for example the creative pleasure in the age of the artisan.
> Task significance is measured with “My job provides opportunities to substantially improve the welfare of guest."

This is a little extreme, but it highlights the concept. Interestingly, there is an organisation called 80000 hours which is related to the effective altruism organisation, and they also do a lot of job satisfaction research summary and career advice. One of the main arguments that they make is that job satisfaction is primarily driven by task significance, and that you should design your career to have the largest social impact that you can to increase your job satisfaction and the world. Although they have gained a lot of popularity recently for various reasons, their argument hinges on how significant task signifiance really is.

Firstly, in regards to motivation, the motivation to do prosocial work is based on the extent to which the nature of your work allows you to interact with those who benefit from it (25) - by frequency, proximity, duration, depth, and breadth of contact. This means that the 80k argument to benefit others indirectly (eg by donating) won't have as large of an effect on your JS as they expect.

But most critical of 80k's mission is that the relationship between Perceived Social Impact, and Perceived Social Worth is moderated by _conscientiousness_ (see dispositional characteristics/big 5), and _pro-social values_.
Conscientiousness negatively mediates the relationship - ie the higher the conscientiousness, the lower the effect of task significance on job performance (due to effective performance and high effort being a reward in itself). And the higher the pro-social values, the higher the effect of task significance on job performance (due to them being more influenced by perceived social value and worth).

#### Pro-Social Values
To measure prosocial values, (27) use the benevolence subscale of the Portrait Values Questionnaire:

> It's very important to him to help the people around him. He wants to care for other
> people.
> It is important to him to be loyal to his friends. He wants to devote himself to people
> close to him.
> It is important to him to respond to the needs of others. He tries to support those he
> knows.
> Forgiving people who might have wronged him is important to him. He tries to see
> what is good in them and not to hold a grudge.


### Task Feedback

Task feedback / also known as feedback from te job, is te extent to wic a job imparts informatiton about an individuals performance. Or roughly, the degree to which the work itself provides feedback of how well one is performing at the job.

Task feedback was measured by askin:

> To wat extent does _doing the job itself_ provide you wit information about your work performance? Tat is, does te actual _work itself_ provide clues about ow well you are doin -- aside from any 'feedback' co-workers or supervisors may provide?

## Growth Needs Strength

Though the job characteristics is a strong predictor of job satisfaction, as a eneral principle - te stronest, the effect of job caracters on job satisfaction was found to be moderated by an individuals needs for growth in what's called the Growth Need Strength. For those high in GNS, the correlation between job characteristics and job satisfaction is very high at an average of 0.57, which is the strongest correlation we have, but for those low in GNS it is .32, which is still quite a strong relationship, but less strong. You can measure your GNS quickly and easily [here](http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/007040187x/student_view0/chapter5/self-assessment_5_6.html). The scale ranges from 12-60, with low growth needs being 12-29, moderate being 30-42, and high being 43-60. My GNS is 32, which is moderate. This means that the correlation is around .44-.53 ? Interestingly, I did the test around one year later, forgetting my previous results, and scored 38 again which is still in moderate, demonstratin its stability.

Wat tis sows is tat altou te JCM is one of te most important factors in determinin wat type of job you sould seek out, you sould weit it slitly less tan oter factors if your NS is low. Put rouly speakin - you need a less enain job to be sastsfied.

## Extending the Job Characteristics Model

The JCM comprises the 5 core motivational characteristics, but 5 more were further identified later on as being potentially important, and discussed in the literature:

- Task variety, wic we discussed above
- Job Complexity
- Information Processin
- Specialization
- Problem Solvin

The JCM and task variety are concerned with the nature of the job itself, whereas these other 4 are focused with the knowledge demands of the work.

### Information Processing

Information Processing is the extent to which a job requires the individual to focus on and manage information. Jobs differ in their required levels of monitoring and processing of information. Jobs that have higher processing requirements are expected to be jobs with more knowledge required in order to complete their work.

### Job Complexity

Job complexity is the extent to which a job is multifacted and difficult to perform. As a result they tend to be mentally demanding. Oddly, although high complexity is expected to increase job satisfaction, it is also more likely to promote stress and feelings of work overload, even if engaging.

### Specialization

Specialization is the extent to which a job involves the performance of tasks requiring specific knowledge and skill, and the depth of them (rather than skill variety).

### Problem Solving

Problem solving is the extent to which a job requires the production of unique solutions or ideas - by innovating, solving nonroutine problems, and dealing with (or preventing) errors.

# 2. Social Characteristics

The third school of thought on what constitutes job satisfaction is that people primarily derive their job satisfaction from the people they surround themselves with. It's established that humans are social animals and are generally positively affected by socialising, making is more energetic, happier, excited, enthusiasm, and it is a fundamental motivation.

Lately, researchers have thought social characteristics via the relationships between workers as being among the most important causes of job satisfaction. This fits with most of our intution that working with people you dislike is terrible. The ways in which social characteristics may influence job satisfaction are many, but the ones that have been noted as potentially important are:

- Social Information Processing: ie conforming to others
- The extent to which the job Deals With Others / aka Interdependence
- Feedback from Others
- Social support
- Interaction Outside the Organisation
- Small Talking
- Being offered friendship opportunities on the job

ie good relationships with your colleagues, from 80k vid series
_use the horsemen from john gottman_, as well as karl venenburgs authentic listening.

## Social Information Processing

Social information processing is the theory that employees look to coworkers to make sense of and develop attitudes about their work. (if your coworkers are [dis]satisfied, so will you be.) As a rivaling theory to JCM, Jex (2002) argues employees look to coworkers to see what their levels of job satisfaction are, and the attitudes they have about their work. If their coworkers attitudes are positive, they will more likely be satisfied, and the converse. This is interesting because new hires can be 'tainted' during the socialization process if placed around dissatisfied employees.

It is less about what job or criteria help in promoting job satisfaction and moreso about the social influences on the perceptions of the job characteristics themselves.

// TODO
Generally the research supports social information processing as having an affect on job satisfaction, but the strength is ?

## Dealing With Others / Interdependence

Interdependence is the extent to which your work relies on interacting with others in a team to complete. The more interaction it requires, the higher the interdependence. It is the extent to which a job is contingent on the work of others, and other jobs are dependent on the work of yours.

## Feedback From Others

This is about the extent to which other organizational members provide performance information/feedback to an individual, different from the JCM feedback from the job itself.

## Social Support

This is the extent to which a job provides opportunities for getting assistance and advice from supervisors or coworkers.

## Interaction Outside the Organisation

This is the extent to which a job requiries an individual to communicate with people (eg suppliers or customers) external to the organization, ie serving the public.

## Small Talking

You would think that being able to chat with coworkers on the job would be quite important for job satisfaction, but it only has a mere .04 correlation, but a .11 correlation with net emotional state while on the job. (kahneman 2006 measurement.pdf

# 3. Work Context Characteristics / Environmental Determinants

Work Context Characteristics are a relatively neglected area of research, but it involves the features of the working environment itself that may influence job satisfaction, the three most noteworthy being:

- Physical Demands / Ease
- Work Conditions
- Ergonomics

These are expected to influence job satisfaction via being more related to biological concerns for safety and survival.

## Physical Demands / Ease

The extent to which a job involves physical strength, endurance and activity requirements of a job.

## Work Conditions

Work conditions captures aspects of the environment generally, such as health hazards, temperature, and noise.

## Noise

Being exposed to offensive noise while at work only affects job satisfaction by a mere -.04, but has a bigger affect than any other factor on net emotional state while doing the job, at a whopping -.90 correlation. (kahneman 2006 measurement.pdf) This means that noise pollution while working basically makes a job disssatisfying more than any other factor.

## Heat / Cold

I couldn't seem to find any research done directly on job satisfaction.

## Ergonomics

Ergonomics involves the extent to which work permits appropriate posture and movement.

## CO2 / Air pollution

Although there is a dizzying array of research on the effect of CO2 on job performance, I couldn't seem to find any research done directly on job satisfaction.

# 4. Dispositional / Worker Characteristics

Dispositional Caracteristics are the extent to which job satisfaction is a result of internal traits of the worker. Some people may just be optimists or pessimists in regards to their work. Te idea is tat certain personality traits - eg how neurotic you are, can influence your evaluation of _any_ job. Though it doesnt plan to invalidate JCM or social caracteristics, but to explain why those eneral principles dont account for all of te variation in job satisfaction.

Its one of te latest metods of explaining job satisfaction, and it argues that it hinges on personality and individual traits, and that some people are inclined to be satisfied or dissatisfied with their work irrespective of the job characteristics or other factors (Jex 2002)

The support for this idea is a few fold:

- Unhappy children become dis­
  satisfied workers later in life (Staw, Bell, and Clausen, 1986 ).
- JS is partly eritable (see Arvey, Carter, and Buerkley, 1991 ).
- Different individuals wit te same jobs ave differin levels of JS
- People rate different jobs and employers relatively stably over time
- - prior job satisfaction is a stronger predictor of current job satisfaction than changes in pay or status.
- ref for above : Summary of ch9 'Job Satisfaction - subjective well-being at work' 2008 pp393-413. (from lukeprog happiness references, “job satisfaction is strongly correlated with happiness”) p 401

There are a handful of dispositional and personality characteristics which are potentially relevant to JS, but the three most important aspects of personality are:

- The Big Five Personality traits - The 5 core personality traits which have been shown to be related to a wide range of different domains and outcomes
- The 4 Core Self-Evaluations
- Positive vs Negative Affectivity (Emotions)

### Genetics
And fourthly, considering the hereditary nature of job satisfaction, these personality traits are believed to be partly genetic and heritable, with genes explaining up to 30% of the variation in job satisfaction (Arvey et al., 1989) (2: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27504661). That is, the genes of monozygotic twins (genetically identical) explained .29 correlation with JS, where dizygotic twins (genetically dissimilar) explained -0.02 (28). So it's clear that there's a genetic relationship, but interestingly, the relationship only moderated job characteristics, and not external characteristics such as pay.

#### Spillover Hypothesis & Life Satisfaction

In Psychology, the spillover-crossover model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover-crossover_model) examines the relationship in how the work domain affects the home domain, and vice versa. Specifically, it converns how well-being is transmitted from one to the other. For example, having family conflict at home can spillover and affect your relationships at work.

Related to this is the link between life satisfaction and job satisfaction. Interestingly, it turns out that there is a stronger causal relationship between your happiness on your job, than from your job on your happiness (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/096317909X478557). Research suggests that life satisfaction often precedes and is a good predictor of job satisfaction.

## The Big Five Personality Traits

The big 5 personality traits are Openness, Conscientousness, Extraversion/introversion, Agreeableness/disagreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN). The Big Five is an extremely respected school of thought in Psychology and carries a huge amount of support and widespread consensus as a model, with predictive power for many many fields, only superseded by the power of IQ. There is a lot to say about it, but a basic intro can be found on wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits.

Again, we're curious how this relates to JS. In summary, consciousntess has a consisntetly significant impact on JS, whereas openness has a consciently insignificant effect. The other 3 - neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness, have inconscient relationships.

### Openness To Experience

Openness is characterized by intellectual curiosity, and imagination, and non-conforomity. Although importrant for many other fieds, it has little effect on JS - correlating at 0.0. (bui 2017)

### Conscientousness

Conscientousness is an individuals level of organization, hard work, and motivation in the pursuit of established goals. Consciousness is a strong perdictor of job performance and success, more than any other trait. In fact it's more predictive here than literally anything else besides IQ which is the best predictor.

Given that, it may explain why consciouensness is positively related to JS. It seems to have a consisntelty significant impact on JS, and low consciensness results in low JS.

Correlateion isa bout .26 (bui 2017). highly predictive of work performance.
.26 (judge 2008).

### Extraversion / Introversion

Extraversion is the extent to which individuals are assertive, active, enthusiastic, energetic, and dominant. Roughly speaking they are more socially oriented than their introverted counterparts.

There appears to be a very strong relation btw extraversion and JS.
The correlation is about .24 (bui 17), .25 (judge 2008).

### Agreeableness

Agreeableness is the level of cooperation (trusting of others) and likeableness of an individual, usually resulting in positive social relationships with others. It's unclear whether it affects JS (bui 2017), but the correlate is around .26

### Neuroticism

Neuroticism is the extent to which an individual lacks positive psychological adjustment and emotional stability. Ie high neuroticism = low emotional stability. It's a little more subtle than that, but the gist is that they are more liekly to experience negative emotions - including anxiety, depression, hostility, etc. (bui 2017)

Neuroticism is believed to have the strongest effect on JS Out of all the big 5 traits, but in a negative mannager, and emotional stability has an inversely positive effect. Though some other research contradicts this.

- correlates -.26 (bui 2017), -.29 (judge 2008)

## Core Self-Evaluations (CSE)

Core self-evaluations are a broad personality concept that encapsulate 4 specific personality traits:

- generalized self efficacy
- locus of control
- self-esteem, and
- low neuroticism / ie emotional stability.

The mechanism on job satisfaction is believed to be mediated by the effect that these personality traits have on the perception of job characteristics. If we have a positive self-regard, we are likely to see our jobs positively and undertake ones that are challenging, and vice versa. The various processes that potentially mediate the relationship are that positive core self-evaluations lead us to both seek out and attain more challenging work, and then further perceive the work as more challenging and interesting after (judge 2000). The individuals with positive CSE are also more likely to work towards goals for reasons consistent with their values ( Judge, Bono, Erez, and Locke, 2005 ) which would make them more satisfied.

Overall, the 4 core traits combined together correlate quite highly with job satisfaction at .41 (judge 2000), or .37 (judge 2008), though the individual traits vary. The measures were all originally devised by Judge et al 1997, and including a 1-5 scale (strongly disagree - strongly agree).

### Self-Esteem

Self esteem was measured by using Rosebnbergs 1965 10-item scale, including items such as:

> I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal basis with others
> and
> At times I think I am no good at all

Correlates .43 with job satisfaction (judge 2000)

### Generalized Self-Efficacy

Measured by asking 7 questions, such as:

> I am strong enough to overcome life's struggles
> and
> I often feel that there is nothing that I can do well

Correlates .33 with job satisfaction (judge 2000)

If employees don't believe that they can successfully perform a job, this may results in low job satisfaction, and an organization might want to consider techniques designed to increase employee self-efficacy (eg see Chapter 10 , this volume - org behaviour handbook?)

### Locus of Control

Locus of control is the extent to which an individual believes that he/she has control over events in their life, positive and negative.

Locus of control is measured using 4 items, including:

> When I get what I want, it's usually because I am lucky
> and
> My life is determined by my own actions

Correlates .28 (judge 2000)

### Low Neuroticism / Emotional Stability

Neuroticism is the degree to which an individual experiences feelings of irritability, nervousnessn worry, embarassment, or guilt. It is essentially the same as the big 5 neuroticism trait, but measured in a slightly different way.

Measure by asking the individual to rate their level of agreement with statements such as:

> I am a nervous person
> and
> I am a worrier

## Affective Disposition

Affective Disposition is how likely people experienced positive and negative emotions. If you x, you have higher trait negative affectivity, and positive.

Trait Negative Affectivity (.37) is somewhat more strongly correlated (.-37) to job satisfaction than trait Positive Affectivity (.29). (judge 2008)

Though compared to Core Self-Evaluations, Affective Disposition correlates less strongly to JS, explaining less variance.

# 5. Person-Environment Fit

https://80000hours.org/2014/10/interview-holden-karnofsky-on-the-importance-of-personal-fit/ _
https://80000hours.org/2013/04/how-important-is-fitting-in-at-work/

Having a career which is a good 'fit' for their personality is usually extremely high priority for most people. Person-Environment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person%E2%80%93environment_fit) fit is the most intuitive of theories around what causes job satisfaction. It is a high-level superset of a few other theories - such as personality-job fit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality%E2%80%93job_fit_theory).

It states that job satisfaction is the result of an individual being in the correct environment - one that matches their interests, preferences, personality, "passions", etc. This is the most intuitive because it fits with a lot of the career advice that is out there - namely that the way to find a satisfying job is to firstly discover your interests and passions, and then to find a job that allows you to do those. - basically, to make sure that you put the right person in the right job.

Tere are few main tests wort mentionin based on teir popularity, and/or merits:
1. Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
2. RIASEC / olland Codes
3. Values In Action (VIA)

Although these are not perfect approaches, I think they are better than systematically going through an  uncategorized [list of jobs](https://joboutlook.gov.au/A-Z) and trying forecast what you would and wouldn't enjoy, as people ave a [poor ability](https://80000hours.org/2012/09/do-you-really-know-what-job-will-make-you-happy/) at predictin wat will make tem appy. It could be potentially wort explorin in te cance of findin a career full of tasks tat you love to do.

## Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

A very crude approach of how this could be done is something like te extremely popular Myers Briggs personality test wic most of us ave eard of or taken. It gives you your 4 letter personality type, such as "INTJ", and then lists a bunch of careers at which those personality traits excel, [like](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-careers) this  or [this](http://www.truity.com/personality-type/INTJ/careers).

Although the MBTI jives with a lot of our intuitions, it has very low validity and teres a 50% cance tat you will et a completely different result if you retake te test 3 monts later (ref?). Also, if you are a teenager, research [suggests](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/21/teenagers-lack-of-insight-into-some-of-their-abilities-has-implications-for-career-counselling/) that you have a lack of insight into some of your abilities (what you are good and bad at) and this can have implications for trusting your intuitions over the career that you pick.

## RIASEC / Holland Codes

Stronger and much more supported is the Holland Code Test, aka the RIASEC wic tries cateorized people into 6 different types, bein:

- Realistic/Doers
- Investigative/Thinkers
- Artistic/Creators
- Social/Helpers
- Entreprising/Persuaders, and
- Conventional/Organizers

It is again a similar concept to the MBTI where you divide people up into 6 neat types and then you find jobs that those types like to do. Although it seems almost too convenient, there is research that it works to some extent - with an establised 0.21 correlation with job performance (nye et a 2012). And that correlation makes sense if you consider that jobs are grouped into what type of tasks they involve, and that perhaps people can be divided into the types of tasks they love to do.

Unfortunately te paper referenced above is only interested in job performance and not job satisfaction ere so we cannot see wat we want directly. Tou tere is a stron correlated between job satisfaction and job performance, so we can potentially use it as a proxy. Te paper (nye et al) concluded:

> Last, more research is needed on the relations between vocational interests and other important criteria (e.g., job satisfaction)

Altou tere is a lare amount of researc supportin te idea tat te 6 different types are valid and do exist, its relation to JS is more sparse and inconsisntent. But te findins are tat its relationsi can rane anywere from .15 all te way to .54 (32) ! ow muc you can trust tis is questionable.

A more robust meta analysis of 9000 individuals found only a .1-.2 correlation wit JS (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000187919991727X).

olland did establis tat people are already motivationally drawn into work environment tat are compatible wit teir interests. Tje question is ow tat relates to JS. e also arued tat JS is unlikely to come merely from makin te work more mentally callenin witout bein personally interested in it, e studyin te law is mentally callenin, but many people ave no interest at all in it. (Holland, 1997 )

I think it worth doing the [free test](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/RIASEC/) or the [more accurate](http://www.self-directed-search.com/) and perusing the jobs they recommend [here](https://www.onetonline.org/explore/interests/) out of curiosity to help widen your options. Self directed searc is anoter name of te olland test. Tese tests are basically aptitude tests tat take in self-reported personality factors and output a list of careers tt you mit be well suited for. Ten you ave between 6-20 options to researc more in dept for job caracteristics, etc.

Though there is a stronger version of the holland codes called the _Strong interest Inventory_ which correlates 0.27 with job performance (nye et al 2012), and I recommend doing that test instead if you are going to do one.


## Values In Action (VIA) *
A later and potentially more respected approac is into individual 8strents8, most outstandin bein te [VIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Values_in_Action_Inventory_of_Strengths) test. It can be taken for free [ere ](https://www.viacharacter.org/personality-assessments)

Te test attempts to measure 24 strents wic are composed of 6 virtues (bold):
- **Wisdom and Knowledge**: creativity, curiosity, judgment, love of learning, perspective
- **Courage**: bravery, perseverance, honesty, zest
- **Humanity**: love, kindness, social intelligence
- **Justice**: teamwork, fairness, leadership
- **Temperance**: forgiveness, humility, prudence, self-regulation
- **Transcendence**: appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, spirituality

80000 ours [tink](https://80000hours.org/2016/02/how-important-is-finding-a-career-that-matches-your-strengths/) te strent of te evidence as it results to JS isnt too i, and may be more important for job craftin tan selection - tat is, it may not be useful for pickin a career but may increase your job satisfaction slitly if you utilize your strents in your current job.

Tou I found some more recent researc wic directly looked at te relatonsips. First, it turns out tat different strents corrlate differently wit job satisfaction, wit te most ily bein (33):
- Hope .31
- Zest .30
- Curiosity .15
- Love .08
- ratitude and Spirituality .07, and
- Persistence .06

Tis is a similar list to wic correlate most iliy wit life satisfaciton.

>The 24 character strengths together accounted for 12% of the variance in job satisfaction beyond gender, age, and education.

Another paper which looked at the correlation of all 24 strengths at work found that they only correlate 0.07 (34)

## Fit Is Pickin Wat You Might Excel At
Most of te oter person-environment fit approaces are focused on your interests and preferences and matcin tem wit te job. But a [later scool of tout](https://80000hours.org/2014/10/interview-holden-karnofsky-on-the-importance-of-personal-fit/) is tat fit is about ow likely you are to exceed at your job, and tis could potentially be importrant for JS as perfomin ily in your job can lead to JS.

See the job performing section.

# Other Factors

Beyond the five main schools of thought above, there has been a lot of separate research into individual variables which affect job satisfaction. I've included research on those below that I believe are the most noteworthy.

## Income
Income level is obviously one of the top factors that people weight when career planning or predicting what jobs are satisfying. Obviously this has been recognized by JS researchers. Warr (1999) simply referred to it as the "availability of money for needs".

To start off with, it used to be thought that the social norm to work was the cause that unemployment made people unhappy, but it turns oout that it is is not affected by the social norm to work, but instead it was found that affluence and possessing money in and of itself was what mattered (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0950017014564602).

If high income were important, you could look at base rates for starting and lifetime income  such as here ( https://www.bls.gov/bls/wages.htm or  https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000) (ref https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vADtvr9iDeYsCDfxd/value-of-information-four-examples#Choosing_a_Career) and try to optimize your career based on that. This is a more efficient approach than what most do. But the question is does it increase JS?

Hackman originally noted in the JCM (Hackman, Oldham (1975) Development of the Job Diagnostic Survey.) that if pay is low, job redesign by improving the JCM might fail,
He noted that pay might also be more important if you have lower Growth Needs Strength (hashlink).

Ok so what's the effect on JS? First, as you would expect, high income does not actively make you happy, but low income actively makes you unhappy. So aim for the absence of a low income rather than the presence of a high income. How much is high/low?

Firstly, a lot of pay satisfaction comes down to it being Pay That You Think Is Fair, which is quite subjective. There are two components to that:
- How much pay you receive relative to how much you BELIEVE you should receive
- How much pay you receive relative to others doing the same or similar jobs

Both of these moderate whether you think a pay is fair ot not (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0047272795015647) which influences your satisfaction with it.

A really good and comprehensive review of the effect on income on happiness and JS was done by 80000hours [here](https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/) and a quick summary [here](https://80000hours.org/2012/09/does-money-make-you-happy/). Though here is an overview:
As you've probably heard, research shows diminishing returns to increased income levels.
As the income level increases, its effect on happiness flattens out.

The effect of income on an individuals happiness (maximizing positive emotions, minimizing negative emotions, and minimizing stress) starts to flatten out at:
- 37k AUD/yr - 700AUD/wk
- 26k USD/yr - 600USD/wk

And *completely* peaks, with the effect becoming non-existent at:
- 58K AUD/yr - 1100AUD/wk
- 40k USD/yr - 800USD/wk

This is much lower than most people expect, because all of the studies are done on household incomes which people conflate with individual incomes. But, the effect of this is mediated by which country you grew up in and your cultural context.

And finally, related specifically to JS itself, pay level was found to correlate only .15 with job satisfaction (31).

So the conclusion is not to aim for income to increase job satisfaction.

## Job Status

Job Status is to the extent that your position is socially valued by others, which in turn influences your perceived social worth. A paper also calls it simply _self respect from the job_ (warr 1999). For example, lawyers and doctors are two conventionally high status positions. This is one of the top criteria that younger people select by (interesting view [here](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html))

A low status job affects job satisfaction with a -.23 correlation, but only affects net emotional state on the job by -.12. (kahneman 2006 measurement.pdf)

## Job Performance / Being Good At Your Job

As noted many times throughout here, job performance and job satisfaction are tightly linked.

How well you do at your job has a bidirectional effect on job satisfaction - meaning that the more satisfied you are with your job the better you perform, and also the better you perform, the more satisfied you are with your job. Both job satisfaction improves job performance, and job performance improves job satisfaction ([ref from 80k?](https://80000hours.org/articles/job-satisfaction-research/#3-work-youre-good-at)).

80000hours weights this quite heavily and recommends selecting for work that you could excel at. [There may be some rationale to this argument.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/)

## Stress Level

Research shows that low stress jobs dont make you happy, but rather a challenging job. Some stress is bad, some is good. If you have few demands placed on you then its more likely that youll be bored. (consider falafill)

Moderate stress levels are good for satisfaction good for job satisfaction. http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2005/RAND_TR192.pdf \* resources on improving occupational stress here https://80000hours.org/2016/02/should-you-look-for-a-low-stress-job/ #

## Qualifications

Being overquaified for ones job affects job satisfaction with a -.20 correlation, and affects net emotional state on the job by -.11. (kahneman 2006 measurement.pdf)

If the job you are doing requires specialized education or training, it positively job satisfaction with a .20 correlation, and net emotional state on the job by 0.10 . (kahneman 2006 measurement.pdf)

## Organisation Size

Organisation size also impacts job satisfaction.

> On average, employees who worked in smaller enterprises with 5 to 19 employees reported higher levels of satisfaction with their current job (5.54 / 7) than employees who worked for medium sized (20-199 people) (5.39 / 7) and larger enterprises (200+ people) (5.32 / 7).

(https://www.fwc.gov.au/resources/research/australian-workplace-relations-study/first-findings-report/6-employee-experiences/job-satisfaction-employees)

Also, slightly unrelated to job satisfaction, but quite noteworthy is a set of research called the _whitehall studies_, and what was found was that the larger the organisation, the more stratification there is between classes of workers, and the greater the job stress for those lower (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall_Study#Explanations_and_Implications).

## Gender

Females are more satisfied with their job than male employees on average (https://www.fwc.gov.au/resources/research/australian-workplace-relations-study/first-findings-report/6-employee-experiences/job-satisfaction-employees). Male employees are more affected by the level and autonomy and control over their work, whereas females are more affected by work-life balance (balancing work and non-work commitments)

## Working Speed / Pressure

If your job requires that you are under constant pressure to work fast, it negatively affects job satisfaction with a -.19 correlation, and affects net emotional state on the job by -.28. (kahneman 2006 measurement.pdf) Does this make hospitality a bad choice? Potentially.

If your job requireed constant attention to avoid mistakes, it affects job satisfaction negatively by only -.04 correlation, but it affects net emotional state on the job by -.13. (kahneman 2006 measurement.pdf)

## Employment Type

Recall that life satisfaction is a global measure of how happy people rate their lives.
It turns out that whether you are employed or not has a strong relation to this. You would think that being able to louze around all day would make you happy, but it turns out that unemployed people are less satisfied with their lives and unhappier than employed (36). People on government bucks also have double the life dissatisfaction of the employed.

So employment makes you happier than unemployment, but self-employment happens to make you very-very slightly less satisfied.

Within those that have regular employment - part time workers have slightly higher life satisfaction and well-being than full-time workers.

There would be a lot of relationships to tease out here - eg self-employed may be less happy due to optimizing for income, and employees for reduced responsibilities. But the results are interesting nonetheless: that there is a higher percentage of self employed people with very low life satisfaction than employed, and a higher percentage of part time workers with high life satisfaction than full-time workers, by ~10%.

The conclusion is that being jobless is not the solution to the 80,000hours of work problem. What you want is challenging work that increases JS and life satisfaction - to work on something that you love.

### Hours Worked
As mentioned above, part time workers (<38h/wk) have higher overall life satisfaction than full-time workers (38h+/wk) (37). But they also have slightly higher job satisfaction:
- Part time workers rate their JS are 5.56 / 7
- Full time workers are 5.37 / 7

This fits with our intuition that having time affluence is better for our well-being, but laso contradicts our desire for wealth. It is noted by a lot of JS Models as a 'hygiene factor' - that is, hours worked may only begin to affect JS when the hours become obsessively long.

For a full exploration of the effect of time scarcity on well-being, I recommend the book Happy Money.

## Creative Occupations

Creative occupations (architecture, crafts, design, music, performing arts, and visual arts) report having above *average* levels of well-being, but also above average levels of anxiety.

Jobs in marketing and advertising, film, TV, video, radio and photography, IT,
and publishing are associated with lower levels of wellbeing than non-creative jobs
https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/creative-occupations-and-subjective-wellbeing/)

Unfortunately I couldn't find anything relating to JS.

## Sleep Quality
I can't seem to find any great studies of the effect of sleep quality on JS (send some over if you can find, I'd love to see), but the importance of sleep quality for life satisfaction and well-being is [one of the most significant variables](https://medium.com/@adxm/the-14-evidence-based-principles-to-optimize-your-sleep-bb0f31200cb2), so it would only make sense for it to spillover to JS as well.

## Age

Age does not appear to have any significant impact on JS (bui 2017).

## Commute Time
People who have long commutes are much more miserable than people with short commutes. The fact that people undervalue their commute to work even has it's own name - The Commuting Paradox (29).

In terms of experience, commuting is the least enjoyable of 19 daily activities measured in a well-designed study of how people spent their time and feel about it (30).

Distance to work is established as one of the biggest determinants of well-being, but I can't find anything directly testing its correlation to JS. Related to well-being, commuters have lower life-satisfaction, a lower sense that their daily activities are worthwhile, lower happiness and higher anxiety levels than non-commuters. (https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140725230415/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/commuting-and-personal-well-being--2014/sty-commuting-and-well-being.html?format=hi-vis)

Average happiness levels begin to fall after the first 15 minutes of the commute to work, then the negative effects peak at 61-90mins and remain stably detrimental after. The except is when you get to 3h+ each way, the negative effects begin to disappear - suggesting this subset of people might have different expectations and perceptions about their commute.

(same ref as above) If you are travelling by car or private vehicle, those travelling less than 15 minutes each way are happier than those travelling 16min +  by the same method. If you are travelling by bus, those spending more than 30min+ commuting were less happy the latter. If you are travelling by train, there's no adverse effects on well-being up to 30mins compared to those in cars and buses, but after 30 minutes of travel, happiness levels dropped for those travelling by any method. Interestingly, those cycling or walking to work btw 16-30mins had lower happiness than those travelling only 15 mins by any method, but people cycling 30mins or more to work had similar levels of those travelling only up to 15 mins by other methods.

# ESM

The sad news is that almost everything in this article is based on self-report by asking people to rate 1-10 how satisfied they feel with their work - the whole thing or certain aspects of it. Unfortunately there's many issues with doing this that make the validity questionable, but fortunately a lot of independent measures corroborate peoples ratings - eg behavioural effects of high and low JS such as turnover, absenteeism, workplace behaviours correlate highly with JS reports.

In saying that, the gold standard for measurement is the Experience Sampling Method (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13594320444000137?journalCode=pewo20 ) (ESM) which pages people many times throughout the day to get real-time reports on peoples moods rather than post-hoc ratings which are more tainted. The ESM measures *now and there* not *later and elsewhere*.

Unfortunately there doesn't have been too much research done with this method (though what has [is](https://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jus/0303/bishay.pdf) interesting). From my elementary search, it seems like theres barely anything done on non-teachers or which jobs are best, or which aspects of the job, only that personality/beliefs have a role. So basically what's been done ignores most job satisfaction research. But I believe the ESM will be the future of how the studies are conducted and is promising to keep an eye on if you're interesting in this stuff.

Daniel Kahneman has done large scale ESM studies though (See 'experienced wellbeing' chapter of Thinking Fast and Slow), which includes the moods of people at work:
> Mood at work, for example, is largely unaffected by the factors that influence general job satisfaction, including benefits and status. More important are situational factors such as an opportunity to socialize with coworkers, exposure to loud noise, time pressure (a significant source of negative affect), and the immediate presence of a boss (in our first study, the only thing that was worse than being alone). Attention is key. Our emotional state is largely determined by what we attend to, and we are normally focused on our current activity and immediate environment. There are exceptions, where the quality of subjective experience is dominated by recurrent thoughts rather than by the events of the moment.

This is quite interesting because it indicates that whats important to people moment-to-moment at work contradicts what some of our findings here are about JS - eg noise exposure, supervisor presence, and time-pressure all negatively affect JS, and coworker socializing positively influencing it, seemingly.

Though further work is to be done.

# Research Summary

So there we have it, X total variables of potential interest to job satisfaction. That's a whole lot of information to take into account when selecting for how you might spend 80,000 hours of your life, and a whole lot of complexity, contradictors, ambiguities, personal differences, and weights to take into account. How to even begin thinking about this? Hopefully this research summary was a start.

The best paper I came across in this whole process was the 2007 paper by Humphrey and Nahgrang that meta-analysed 260 different studies, including 220k participants, and looked at 14 work characteristics (sections 1-3 here). I've listed them below and due to the large sample size and inter-comparisons, I would trust the validity of these more than most of the others. They found it explained beyong 55% of the variance in job satisfaction which is basically the most we can get at this point. What that means is that if you took 2 random people with different lives, personalities, and jobs, you could basically predict about 50% of what their job satisfaction would be by looking at these 14 variables.

Those 14 work characteristics (1,0 below) include the Motivational Characteristics (which explained 17% of JS variance), Social Characteristics (which explained 17%), and Work Context (mere 4%).

Here is a complete summary of all of the variables and correlations mentioned throughout this article, the most important part of this whole article:

# Application \*****

So how can we take this dump of data and try to find actionable insights in it?
Since as we discussed each variable has the possibility of facilitating job satisfaction or job dissatisfaction, our best bet statistically is to commonsensically weight heaver which correlate more, and weight the variables less which correlate less.

Lets get the uncontrollable variables out of the way. When trying to increase job satisfaction, your age is not at all relevant, so do not use that as an excuse. If you are a female, you are lucky in that you are statistically slightly more likely than your male counterpart to be satisfied with your job. How much attention your job requires is also negligible, and that's basically it. The rest is within your circle of control.

Although you would think your genetics are chance, which they are, they are expressing their affects on your JS predominantly through your personality, which I'll discuss shortly.

As for unknowns - who knows whether the ergonomics, temperature, CO2 / air quality level, noise level, job specialization, or problem solving affects JS. The best thing we can do here is to experiment with it ourselves and make subjective ratings during those days, or to hold on for better studies in the future. It is unknown to what *extent* sleep affects JS but it almost certainly does in some way. The same for stress level, but good stress is different from bad stress. Also, your job satisfaction may be mediated by conforming to the evaluations are you (social information processing), but its hard to know by how much.

Also the correlate between small talking on the job, physical demands of the job, and interacting with outside of the organisation are so small that they are not worth paying attention to. Creative jobs are also slightly more satisfying than non, but not so much that you should weight it highly.

Now for the cream of the crop: what actual job should you select for?

The most important take away that I haven't highlighted yet is the strength of correlation that Social Support received - a whopping .59, even more than JCM. Recall that social support is a measurement of how assisting your supervisors and coworkers are. How this affects us is that making sure that you like the people that you work with will have the largest effect on whether you will likely find your job satisfying or not, so make sure to get this one right. Obviously you won't know the people in your organisation until you work there, but you should keep this knowledge in your mind to weight each job that you try. This criteria is starting to be acknowledged by many orgs and they are referring to it as "culture fit".

Okay so you know you should work with people you like, but in which type of job? As mentioned earlier, there are [job listings](https://joboutlook.gov.au/A-Z) out there that you could systematically go through, but it wouldn't help for 3 reasons: they don't list the criteria you care about for each job (like the JCM), you don't know how much personal fit you have for each job, and it's overwhelming. They usually only list pay scales and growth of the industry which is not very meaningful.

As we saw, the JCM are highly important for JS and will be the main metric by which you weight different jobs. I'll remind you that you should take the GNS to figure out how much you should weight it for assessing different jobs. It only takes about 2 minutes.

I've tried my best to find research which lists different types of jobs according to their job characteristics (in the JCM) but to no avail. Ideally, job listings like the ones above would be ranked according to criteria of job satisfaction.

As far as I know, there is no comprehensive research done on job satisfaction and job characteristics by job type unfortunately.
I did find one paper (38)  which measured global JS across 50k participants and found the following:

![jsjobs](jsjobs.png)

Which is interesting and indicative, but I wouldn't weight it *too* highly.

The other best and crudest thing that I could find was [this](https://www.fwc.gov.au/resources/research/australian-workplace-relations-study/first-findings-report/6-employee-experiences/future-intentions) which measures intention to change fields by industry, which you would assume somewhat correlates with JCM. You could potentially use these rates to inform your decision of how dissatisfied people are in different industries. At a high level, food and accomodation services, arts and recreation services, and admin and support services all have the highest turnover intentions. mining, professional, scientific and technical services, construction, [public admin and safety](https://joboutlook.gov.au/IndustrySpecific?search=Industry&Industry=O), and IT have the lowest.

I think a better approach to filtering jobs is to start with your passions, interests, and strengths, even if not perfect, and then filter by JCM and job complexity. I would weight job complexity and JCM about equally as highly. So the more complex the job, the better.

Don't take the MBTI / Myers Briggs, unless you're doing so for entertainment, as it's basically useless for our purposes. I would instead take the [RIASEC / Hollands](#RIASEC--Holland-Codes) and figure out what your type is, and then peruse the job listings, making a shortlist. This is not a be-all-end-all though, you should keep your options open for jobs not on here, as it only correlates .10-20 remember? But it's a useful filter.

Then once you have a list, I would email, talk to, meet, interview, etc, as many people that you can from those jobs and try to assess to the best of your ability how they rank on the JCM - potentially even using the direct questions from the surveys, and also on job complexity and information processing. As for weighting the JCM - as you saw, weight decision-making autonomy the highest, equal with task variety, and then skill variety/feedback from the job second. It might be worth doing the pros-social values test and its definitely worth doing the big 5 test, and use both the pros-social values and conscientousness to weight task signifinance of the job. If you are low in conscientousness or pro-social values, then you shouldn't weight task signifiance highly at all, as having a social important won't be as important to you as engaging work will be in and of itself. Task identity can be weighted pretty low.

Once you find jobs that seem like a good personal fit, and have the JCM, it might be worth trying to do an unpaid internship, volunteering, or participation in workshops just to try to get as close as you can to the day to day tasks of the job and assess how you feel doing it.

Hopefully the above gets you 90% of the way there. If not, the ~.20-.30 correlations may be worth cross checking, and make sure that:
* you're not overqualified for the job
* that it preferably requires specialized education
* It doesn't require fast working speed (like hospitality)
* The job isn't low status
* That you preferably get to interact with others inside the organisation as a part of your job / Interdependnece (weight this more highly than the previous)
* That you get social feedback from others for the work you're doing
* You're performing well

Besides all of that, the only other thing you should weight in your job is the size of the organisation, which should ideally be <20 people.

## Post-Career Selection
Once you've decided on career, or are in one, there is a handful of things that are still within your control to maximize your job satisfaction.

If you are already in a job and it is low in the JCM, there's a handful of things that you can do to increase them, and the mental challenge that results (also useful for managers):
1. job rotation – rotate employees from one job to another once mastered and no longer challenged.
2. job enlargement/horizontal loading – expand/add tasks to a particular job. > increased variety
3. job enrichment/vertical loading – add responsibilities (like staffing, scheduling, performance appraisals) > increased autonomy

First, change jobs or negotiate salary if your income is less than 700 per week, non-negotiable, as this can invalidate everything else. Once it is over that, it is sufficient to optimize JS.

The second most non-job characterstic improvement that you can make after your income is above 700$/wk is to live as close to work as possible. The negative effect on this on job dissatisfaction is just as dramatic as the negative effects of low income. Ideally you are within 15 minutes of walking/cycling distance. Weight distance over transport mode.

You might be slightly happier working part-time than full-time, but only if it doesn't negatively affect your income too much. If you can find a work situation in a job that you fits all the other criteria, is close to work, and still pays well whilst allowing you to work part-time, you should definitely experiment with it as a means of improvement your JS.

Now that your job and environment is taken care of, the last thing within your control is **you** and your personality.

It is worth taking the VIA on the off chance that Hope, Zest, or Curiosity are in your top 3 strengths. If they are, you might be slightly more satisfied if you find ways to actively use them each day - like [this](https://www.actionforhappiness.org/media/52486/340_ways_to_use_character_strengths.pdf). If they aren't, you shouldn't weight VIA at all.

Okay so we established that your personal life has spill-over effects on your work-life, but its unsure how much. What's not uncertain and the most important of your personality traits is how neurotic you are and how much you experience negative emotions - ie trait negative affectivity. I highly recommend doing the BIG5 / Five Factor personality test  [here](https://understandmyself.com) - as this is very useful information to have for self-knowledge and self-understanding, and quite actionable.

If it turns out that if you are a neurotic person and quite susceptible to negative emotions, there is a lot of different things that you can try, but you should know that many people worse off than yourself have found things that worked well for them, so don't abandon this too soon. It's worth starting [here](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/#2-if-necessary-make-mental-health-your-top-priority), and trying [these](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/) evidenced-based treatments for depressive moods, or [these](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/13/things-that-sometimes-work-if-you-have-anxiety/) for anxious.

If it turns out that you are not very neurotic, the next few things that you should give equal importance to from the big5 are increasing your extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientousness, by trying [these](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9/how-to-be-happy#Happiness__personality__and_skills). Don't focus on openness at all (at least not for job satisfaction).

Even more important than any of the BIG5 traits (including neuroticism) is your self-esteem. Your self-esteem is the biggest personality variable which can mediate JS, and you can attempt to improve it [by trying these](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9/how-to-be-happy#Happiness__personality__and_skills). Less important but still so are your self-efficacy and locus of control. A basic primer on improving locus of control is [this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RWo4LwFzpHNQCTcYt/how-to-beat-procrastination#spirals), but for a more thorough treatment, CBT is basically a match for this - have a look at the book Learned Optimism by Martin Seligman. As for self-efficacy, it might be worth trying some of [these](https://positivepsychology.com/3-ways-build-self-efficacy/) or researching farther.

If that all sounds overwhelming, 80000 hours again has some good [advice](https://80000hours.org/2014/12/stop-worrying-so-much-about-the-long-term/) which is:
> Especially if you’re at the start of your career, try not to worry too much about what you’re going to do long-term. Instead, focus on making your next decision. | The best way to take account of the long-term is to focus on taking a step that will improve your career capital and help you learn more.

and William MacAskill (one of the EA founders), in his TED talk, recommends learning things to build skills if you're unsure about what to do long-term.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the final take away from all of this to keep it simple is to do the following, in order of priority:

**The Job**
* The most important characteristic of a job is that it is socially supporting in allowing you to receive feedback, from your supervisors and coworkers
* [Do](http://www.self-directed-search.com/) the RIASEC test and [explore](https://www.onetonline.org/explore/interests/) the results for your code as a starting point, listing down jobs of interest
* Potentially use [industry turnover stats](https://www.fwc.gov.au/resources/research/australian-workplace-relations-study/first-findings-report/6-employee-experiences/future-intentions) and the jobs chart above to mildly inform your decision
* Interview, email, meet, many people working the jobs you are interested in, and question them specifically on the Job Characteristics Model
* Quickly [do](http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/007040187x/student_view0/chapter5/self-assessment_5_6.html) the Growth Needs Strength to see how much to weight the JCM
* Weight decision-making autonomy and task-variety the highest in job characteristics, followed by job-complexity, then skill-variety, task significance, feedback from the job, and lastly identity
* Do the [pro-social values test](#pro-social-values) and the BIG5 [test](https://understandmyself.com), using the former and your conscientousness to moderate the effect of JCM task significance
* Experiment with short-listed jobs, by volunteering, doing unpaid internships, or workshops, to get as close to the jobs daily tasks as you can, and re-assess JCM and personal fit
* Ensure the absence of: overqualification, underqualification, fast working speed, low status, working alone, no social feedback from others, and poor performance
* Optimally work for an organisation with < 20 people
* Once you are in a job, to improve JCM, try: rotating jobs, adding tasks/variety to your job, adding responsibility/autonomy to your job
* Negotiate your salary or change jobs if income < 700aud/wk
* Live as close to work as possible, ideally < 15 minutes distance, ideally walking or cycling
* Experiment working part-time > full-time if you have the option and you can maintain your income > 700

**Your Interests**
* Do the RIASEC as per above
* [Do](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths) the VIA test and find [ways](https://www.actionforhappiness.org/media/52486/340_ways_to_use_character_strengths.pdf) to use Hope, Zest, or Curiosity daily if they are in your top 3 strengths

**You**
* Improve your self-esteem by trying [these](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9/how-to-be-happy#Happiness__personality__and_skills)
* Improve your negative moods by trying [these](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/#2-if-necessary-make-mental-health-your-top-priority), [these](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/), and [these](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/13/things-that-sometimes-work-if-you-have-anxiety/)
* Improve your BIG5 extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientousness by trying [these](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9/how-to-be-happy#Happiness__personality__and_skills)
* Improve your locus-of-control by doing [this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RWo4LwFzpHNQCTcYt/how-to-beat-procrastination#spirals)
* Improve your self-efficacy by trying CBT
* If you are overwhelmed by all this and unsure long-term, build skills and focus on making your next decision in a direction that will foster your career

**Other**
* Lastly, experiment with the unknowns and how they affect JS: sleep (most importantly), ergonomics, temperature, CO2/air, noise level, job specialization, stress-reducing interventions, and problem solving

**So basically to find a satisfying career: work a mentally challenging job, with people you like, that ideally suits your personality strengths, that pays okay, close to work, without any obvious negative factors, in a small organisation, preferably part-time, and make sure that you express positive personality traits whilst doing so. If you do this, you will have scientifically and commonsensically maximized your odds at a life of happy work.**

We found that the most important four factors for being satisfied in your work are: 1. Engaging, meaningful work: the extent to which you have variety, autonomy, a sense of completion, feedback and work you feel makes a difference. 2. Getting on with your colleagues: the extent to which you get help from, like and form meaningful relationships with your colleagues. 3. Personal fit: the extent to which you’re good at your job. 4. Hygiene factors: do you have reasonable hours, job security, a short commute and sufficient pay?
